# Narrative Synthesis

## Weaving threads across time so scattered work reads as one story.

When pulling together projects or threads of writing, I ask AI to identify overarching motifs—continuity, transformation, emergence. It reveals the connective tissue between scattered ideas. The resulting synthesis brings coherence to work developed across time and context.

#### Merge — Community Workshops (N-111)

Structured gatherings turned connection into practice. Running workshops created shared language and ongoing support between readers and builders.
