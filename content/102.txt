# People Might Experience a Shift in Job Roles

Imagine standing atop a mountain, gazing out at the horizon. A massive wave approaches – unstoppable, transformative, inevitable.
That wave is AGI, or Artificial General Intelligence.

AGI is the creation of machines with human-level abilities across every domain. More than automation, AGI represents a complete shift in capabilities, ensuring upheaval across our societies and economies. AGI is inevitable. Its emergence will reshape societies, economies, and the very structure of human work. It could also unlock breakthroughs in science, medicine, and sustainability – if we wield it wisely.

How AGI will unfold is anybody’s guess. 

The number of jobs lost to AI is difficult to estimate, but every hiring decision now has to be weighed against AI’s ability to perform the same task. Many sectors will resist assimilation, becoming increasingly artisan. Others, like travel agents after the rise of e-commerce, will specialize briefly before becoming obsolete.

The deeper I explore AI, the more I understand both its promise and its perils. Maintaining hope is essential – but blind optimism is dangerous. 

Yet it is difficult to imagine *any* technology capable of transcending our human and social limitations. Any society incapable of caring for their own is likely to suffer the consequences of complete automation. In a system already struggling with inequality, total automation could be capitalism’s final boss.

History offers no roadmap for this transition. But if we act with foresight, creativity, and collective will, a future worth inhabiting is within reach.
