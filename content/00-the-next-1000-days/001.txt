# What’s at stake?
## Our impending emergency

We are approaching a crossroads, and it’s not hyperbole to call it an emergency. The arrival of AGI won’t be another chapter in technological progress. It will redefine our social fabric, economic systems, and have us question the essence of what it means to be human.

{AGI (Artificial General Intelligence)}

We’ve seen major transformations before—the steam engine, electricity, the internet—but none of those hold a candle to what AGI will unleash. What we face is a shift that we’re ill-prepared for and there little precious time to take action.

We are in the midst of multiple crises—a loneliness epidemic, rising inequality, and the concentration of wealth and resources in ever fewer hands. 

AGI will amplify these issues beyond anything we’ve seen before. It’s not just about technology outpacing human abilities; it’s about systems of power, governance, and social order that could break under the weight of something so transformative, so overwhelming, that we can barely imagine its scope.

AGI isn't just another tool—it’s the last general-purpose technology that we, as a species, will ever invent. What happens after that is beyond our control unless we start preparing now.

### 1. AGI is the Last General-Purpose Technology

The core of the impending emergency is this: AGI will be the final invention we make as a species. From that point forward, it will drive innovation on its own. Human ingenuity, as we know it, will take a backseat. This isn’t just another industrial revolution; this is something entirely different. AGI will reshape every sector and every life. From scientific research to creative work, AI will take over roles that we currently think of as "uniquely human."

The question is: What role will we play in that future? Once AGI becomes self-sufficient, we won’t be the ones driving progress anymore. If we don’t act, we risk becoming obsolete. While this might sound empowering to some—handing off the reins to a smarter, faster intelligence—it's equally terrifying. This is why writing this book is crucial: we need to prepare for this seismic shift and figure out how we can retain agency in a world where we may no longer be the primary creators.


### AGI is the Last General-Purpose Technology
   - **Claim**: AGI will be the final general-purpose technology humans invent. Once AGI becomes self-sufficient, it will take over all future innovation, design, and technological creation. Humanity may no longer be the primary driver of progress. This is both empowering and terrifying.
   - **Why Important**: Like the steam engine, electricity, and the internet, AGI will transform every industry. But unlike those, AGI can innovate without humans, leaving human creativity, employment, and decision-making largely obsolete. This shift raises existential questions about our role in the future.

### 2. AGI Could Accelerate Inequality Beyond Repair

We’re already seeing the widening gulf between the haves and have-nots. The emergence of AGI will take this inequality to unprecedented levels. Imagine a world where only a handful of entities control AGI—whether they’re corporations or governments. Those who possess AGI will hold the keys to the future, while the rest of humanity risks falling into irrelevance.

This isn’t hyperbole; it’s the trajectory we’re on unless we establish global governance frameworks to ensure AGI’s benefits are equitably distributed. If left unchecked, AGI will create a class of elites who control everything, and the gap between the powerful and powerless will become unbridgeable. This book is a call to arms, urging us to act before the chasm becomes too wide to cross.


### AGI Could Accelerate Inequality Beyond Repair
   - **Claim**: AGI will exacerbate wealth and power inequality to an unprecedented degree. A handful of entities controlling AGI could control the entire global economy, locking the majority of humanity into permanent subservience or irrelevance.
   - **Why Important**: Previous technologies, like the Industrial Revolution and digital computing, already worsened inequality, but AGI will take this to the extreme, creating a class of "AGI elites." Addressing this requires urgent global governance and equitable distribution of AGI’s benefits, or societal fractures will deepen irreparably.

### AGI Could Erase the Concept of Human Labor

The Industrial Revolution changed how we work, but it didn’t eliminate labor. AGI could. Physical, cognitive, and even creative labor could all be automated to the point where human participation in the economy is optional. This means we’ll need entirely new economic systems—universal basic income, perhaps, or something even more radical.

But the real question is, what happens to human purpose in a world without work? The psychological and societal impact of mass joblessness isn’t something we can brush off. If we don’t prepare for this now, we risk widespread societal collapse. This book is about acknowledging that threat and exploring how we can rethink work, purpose, and identity in a post-labor economy.

### The Generational Schism: AGI Natives vs. AGI Immigrants

There will be a deep divide between those who grow up with AGI—the AGI natives—and those of us who remember life before it—the AGI immigrants. This divide will be more profound than anything we’ve seen with prior technologies. It won’t just be about familiarity; it will be about fundamentally different ways of thinking, learning, and interacting with the world.

As AGI becomes more ingrained in daily life, the cultural, educational, and psychological gaps between these generations will widen. Preparing for this schism means rethinking how we educate not only the next generation but also ourselves. It’s not just about technical skills; it’s about fostering adaptability, ethics, and resilience in a world shaped by AI.

### AGI Governance is a Global Emergency (Alignment)

AGI isn’t just a technological breakthrough—it’s a global emergency, on par with the climate crisis. We need to mobilize the same level of effort, urgency, and global coordination to ensure AGI is developed and governed responsibly. The time to act is now, before the development of AGI reaches a point where it’s too late to control.

This book is a call to action. It’s not just about raising awareness; it’s about mobilizing global efforts for responsible AGI governance. The stakes are too high to delay.

**What Can Be Done Now**

We can’t afford to wait until AGI is fully realized to start preparing. Global governance frameworks, educational reforms, and equitable distribution of AGI’s benefits must be established now. This book isn’t about predicting the future—it’s about shaping it. If we act with urgency and foresight, we can guide AGI’s development in ways that benefit everyone, not just the few. 

Writing this book is my contribution to that cause.


### AGI Could Erase the Concept of Human Labor
   - **Claim**: AGI will make human labor unnecessary, not just for physical tasks but for cognitive, creative, and intellectual work. This transition could end capitalism as we know it, requiring entirely new economic systems, like universal basic income or post-labor economies.
   - **Why Important**: The Industrial Revolution changed labor but didn’t eliminate it. AGI, however, can automate creativity, decision-making, and innovation, completely redefining the meaning of work. If not managed properly, this could lead to mass societal dislocation, psychological distress, and increased inequality.

### The Generational Schism: AGI Natives vs. AGI Immigrants
   - **Claim**: There will be an irreversible generational divide between those born into a world shaped by AGI (AGI natives) and those who lived through the transition (AGI immigrants). This divide will be deeper and more profound than any prior generational gap.
   - **Why Important**: Previous technological shifts (like the internet) created divides, but AGI will be so transformational that it may create distinct cultural and cognitive differences between generations. Preparing for this schism requires educational reform, cultural adjustment, and psychological support on a global scale.

### AGI Governance Might Need to be Treated as a Global Emergency
   - **Claim**: The development and governance of AGI is an emergency on the scale of the climate crisis. Humanity must mobilize in a similar manner—through global institutions, coordinated research, and shared ethical guidelines—to manage AGI development responsibly.
   - **Why Important**: The climate crisis has taught us the cost of delayed action. AGI could pose even more immediate existential risks if we fail to create global, inclusive, and adaptive governance frameworks. Mobilizing AGI development responsibly should be a top priority for governments, businesses, and institutions.

Nobody is individually capable of shaping the development of AI. It will manifest as a combination of multiple areas of research combined with nearly infinite different applications. Somewhere at the intersection of computer science, statistics, ethics and linguistics sits AI, almost as a culmination of our capabilities. The sum total of what we know. There is no panic button for something like this. Much like how the internet was designed to withstand nuclear war, AI cannot be unplugged. It will keep developing and extending in vectors we can barely fathom. 


How do you talk about something without hyping it? How do you avoid misrepresenting your observations while maintaining a level of excitement about something that is clearly going to affect a lot of people?

I try maintaining an equanimous view of technology – it is neither utopian, dystopian or protopian to me. Technology is an extension of our humanity, and how we utilize it says a lot about our values. Yet it is impossible to judge such hyperobjects in any meaningful way. That doesn’t mean we should abandon morals, but rather not try to classify technology as being something or the other. The only thing that matters is how we use it.

I am not sure whether such equanimity extends to AI. You could argue that all technology is out of our control, and that the technium is a form of superstructure with emergent characteristics and therefore it was never ours to control. But there is something inherently different with autonomous technology. It acts uncannily and messes with our expectations of how technology should behave. AI will only grow in size and relevance, and how it shapes our perception of the world should be strongly considered in how we act, plan and legislate moving forward.

Where it goes from here depends only on us, and our ability to seize the moment, inform ourselves, and make better collective decisions. The alternative is having this inflection point seized by those with deepest pockets, who will inevitably shape the outcome towards greater personal benefit. 

As a collective technology, AI needs to be belong to everyone.
