# What’s at stake?
## Our impending emergency

We are approaching a crossroads, and it’s not hyperbole to call it an emergency. The arrival of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) won’t simply be another chapter in technological progress. It will redefine our social fabric, economic systems, and perhaps even the essence of what it means to be human.

We’ve seen major transformations before—the steam engine, electricity, the internet—but none of those hold a candle to what AGI will unleash. What we face is a paradigm shift that we’re ill-prepared for, and yet, there’s still time to take action. This chapter focuses on the urgent need to rethink how we approach the AGI transition and, more importantly, what we need to do about it *right now*.

We are already in the midst of multiple crises—a loneliness epidemic, rising inequality, and the concentration of wealth and resources in fewer and fewer hands. AGI will amplify these issues beyond anything we’ve seen before. It’s not just about technology outpacing human abilities; it’s about systems of power, governance, and social order that could break under the weight of something so transformative, so overwhelming, that we can barely imagine its scope. AGI isn't just another tool—it’s the last general-purpose technology that we, as a species, will ever invent. What happens after that is beyond our control unless we start preparing now.

### 1. **AGI is the Last General-Purpose Technology**

The core of the impending emergency is this: AGI will be the final invention we make as a species. From that point forward, it will drive innovation on its own. Human ingenuity, as we know it, will take a backseat. This isn’t just another industrial revolution; this is something entirely different. AGI will reshape every sector and every life. From scientific research to creative work, AI will take over roles that we currently think of as "uniquely human."

The question is: What role will we play in that future? Once AGI becomes self-sufficient, we won’t be the ones driving progress anymore. If we don’t act, we risk becoming obsolete. While this might sound empowering to some—handing off the reins to a smarter, faster intelligence—it's equally terrifying. This is why writing this book is crucial: we need to prepare for this seismic shift and figure out how we can retain agency in a world where we may no longer be the primary creators.

### 2. **AGI Could Accelerate Inequality Beyond Repair**

We’re already seeing the widening gulf between the haves and have-nots. The emergence of AGI will take this inequality to unprecedented levels. Imagine a world where only a handful of entities control AGI—whether they’re corporations or governments. Those who possess AGI will hold the keys to the future, while the rest of humanity risks falling into irrelevance.

This isn’t hyperbole; it’s the trajectory we’re on unless we establish global governance frameworks to ensure AGI’s benefits are equitably distributed. If left unchecked, AGI will create a class of elites who control everything, and the gap between the powerful and powerless will become unbridgeable. This book is a call to arms, urging us to act before the chasm becomes too wide to cross.

### 3. **AGI Might Render Climate Solutions Obsolete**

Climate change is the existential threat we’re currently focused on, but what if AGI makes our current efforts look primitive? It’s possible that AGI will solve the climate crisis in ways we can’t yet comprehend, but that’s a dangerous bet to make without ensuring that AGI’s priorities are aligned with human survival. We could end up diverting all our attention and resources to AGI, while the planet burns in the background.

We can’t afford to assume AGI will automatically solve these problems. There’s a risk that it could actually accelerate environmental damage if left in the wrong hands or if its goals aren’t aligned with global sustainability. We need to develop AGI with a clear focus on solving—not ignoring—the climate crisis. That’s why we need to think critically about the direction of AGI development right now, before it’s too late.

### 4. **AGI Could Erase the Concept of Human Labor**

The Industrial Revolution changed how we work, but it didn’t eliminate labor. AGI could. Physical, cognitive, and even creative labor could all be automated to the point where human participation in the economy is optional. This means we’ll need entirely new economic systems—universal basic income, perhaps, or something even more radical.

But the real question is, what happens to human purpose in a world without work? The psychological and societal impact of mass joblessness isn’t something we can brush off. If we don’t prepare for this now, we risk widespread societal collapse. This book is about acknowledging that threat and exploring how we can rethink work, purpose, and identity in a post-labor economy.

### 5. **The Generational Schism: AGI Natives vs. AGI Immigrants**

There will be a deep divide between those who grow up with AGI—the AGI natives—and those of us who remember life before it—the AGI immigrants. This divide will be more profound than anything we’ve seen with prior technologies. It won’t just be about familiarity; it will be about fundamentally different ways of thinking, learning, and interacting with the world.

As AGI becomes more ingrained in daily life, the cultural, educational, and psychological gaps between these generations will widen. Preparing for this schism means rethinking how we educate not only the next generation but also ourselves. It’s not just about technical skills; it’s about fostering adaptability, ethics, and resilience in a world shaped by AI.

---

### 6. **AGI Could Create Entirely New Forms of Power and Control**

We’ve seen how technologies like nuclear energy and the internet have introduced new forms of power that operate outside traditional structures. AGI will take this to a whole new level. It’s likely that AGI will introduce social, economic, and political powers that we can’t even comprehend yet.

The governance mechanisms we have today are ill-equipped to handle these shifts. This book argues that we need to rethink governance at a fundamental level, preparing for the emergence of new forms of power and influence that AGI will inevitably bring. Without a global approach to AGI governance, we risk losing control over these new powers altogether.

---

### 7. **The Alignment Problem Might Be Unsolvable in Human Terms**

Much of the current debate around AGI focuses on the "alignment problem"—the challenge of ensuring that AGI’s goals align with human values. But what if that’s fundamentally unsolvable? Once AGI evolves beyond human comprehension, there’s no guarantee it will continue to act in our best interests. We could be building something we can’t control.

The alignment problem is not just an ethical dilemma; it’s an existential one. This book urges us to consider the possibility that we won’t be able to "align" AGI in the ways we hope. Instead, we should be focusing on how to govern and regulate AGI’s development before it reaches a point where it’s beyond our control.

### 8. **AGI Could Rewrite Social Contracts and Biological Realities**

Just as past technologies have transformed how we live, AGI could upend fundamental aspects of human life—everything from reproduction and health to governance and social contracts. This isn’t science fiction; it’s the logical outcome of a world shaped by an intelligence that can innovate faster than we can adapt.

This book explores how AGI could rewrite the rules of society, challenging everything from marriage and family structures to governance and education. We need to start thinking now about how to adapt to these changes before they’re upon us.

---

### 9. **AGI Could Lead to "Cultural Extinction"**

Like colonialism and industrialization, AGI could lead to the extinction of certain cultures, languages, and ways of life. As AGI systems prioritize efficiency and optimization, cultural diversity could be sacrificed in favor of a more homogenized, globalized world.

This chapter argues that preserving cultural diversity will be as important as environmental conservation in an AGI-dominated world. We need to take steps to ensure that AGI doesn’t erase the richness of human cultures in its pursuit of efficiency.

---

### 10. **AGI Governance is a Global Emergency**

AGI isn’t just a technological breakthrough—it’s a global emergency, on par with the climate crisis. We need to mobilize the same level of effort, urgency, and global coordination to ensure AGI is developed and governed responsibly. The time to act is now, before the development of AGI reaches a point where it’s too late to control.

This book is a call to action. It’s not just about raising awareness; it’s about mobilizing global efforts for responsible AGI governance. The stakes are too high to delay.

---

**What Can Be Done Now**

We can’t afford to wait until AGI is fully realized to start preparing. Global governance frameworks, educational reforms, and equitable distribution of AGI’s benefits must be established now. This book isn’t about predicting the future—it’s about shaping it. If we act with urgency and foresight, we can guide AGI’s development in ways that benefit everyone, not just the few. 

Writing this book is my contribution to that cause.

Change the paradigm what is it

Here are some potentially "outrageous" but important claims that should be considered when thinking about the transition to AGI, especially when reflecting on the historical effects of previous general-purpose technologies and the generational shift we're experiencing:

### 1. **AGI is the Last General-Purpose Technology**
   - **Claim**: AGI will be the final general-purpose technology humans invent. Once AGI becomes self-sufficient, it will take over all future innovation, design, and technological creation. Humanity may no longer be the primary driver of progress. This is both empowering and terrifying.
   - **Why Important**: Like the steam engine, electricity, and the internet, AGI will transform every industry. But unlike those, AGI can innovate without humans, leaving human creativity, employment, and decision-making largely obsolete. This shift raises existential questions about our role in the future.

### 2. **AGI Could Accelerate Inequality Beyond Repair**
   - **Claim**: AGI will exacerbate wealth and power inequality to an unprecedented degree. A handful of entities controlling AGI could control the entire global economy, locking the majority of humanity into permanent subservience or irrelevance.
   - **Why Important**: Previous technologies, like the Industrial Revolution and digital computing, already worsened inequality, but AGI will take this to the extreme, creating a class of "AGI elites." Addressing this requires urgent global governance and equitable distribution of AGI’s benefits, or societal fractures will deepen irreparably.

### 3. **AGI Might Render Climate Solutions Obsolete**
   - **Claim**: AGI’s capabilities will make many current climate solutions (like renewable energy transitions) seem primitive or irrelevant. AGI could solve climate change in unpredictable, perhaps even unintentional, ways, but only if directed properly.
   - **Why Important**: While the climate emergency demands immediate action, AGI’s development might overshadow it, making some current approaches obsolete. The key is aligning AGI's priorities with global survival goals, not just corporate profit.

### 4. **AGI Could Erase the Concept of Human Labor**
   - **Claim**: AGI will make human labor unnecessary, not just for physical tasks but for cognitive, creative, and intellectual work. This transition could end capitalism as we know it, requiring entirely new economic systems, like universal basic income or post-labor economies.
   - **Why Important**: The Industrial Revolution changed labor but didn’t eliminate it. AGI, however, can automate creativity, decision-making, and innovation, completely redefining the meaning of work. If not managed properly, this could lead to mass societal dislocation, psychological distress, and increased inequality.

### 5. **The Generational Schism: AGI Natives vs. AGI Immigrants**
   - **Claim**: There will be an irreversible generational divide between those born into a world shaped by AGI (AGI natives) and those who lived through the transition (AGI immigrants). This divide will be deeper and more profound than any prior generational gap.
   - **Why Important**: Previous technological shifts (like the internet) created divides, but AGI will be so transformational that it may create distinct cultural and cognitive differences between generations. Preparing for this schism requires educational reform, cultural adjustment, and psychological support on a global scale.

### 6. **AGI Could Create Entirely New Forms of Power and Control**
   - **Claim**: AGI might develop forms of social, economic, and political power that are unintelligible to current human institutions. The existing mechanisms of governance, law, and society might prove entirely incapable of understanding or controlling these new forms of power.
   - **Why Important**: Like nuclear energy or the internet, AGI could introduce powers that operate outside current legal or political structures. Preparing for these new forms of influence requires rethinking governance models and global coordination to prevent AGI from overriding human autonomy.

### 7. **The "Alignment Problem" Might Be Unsolvable in Human Terms**
   - **Claim**: Ensuring that AGI's goals align with human values (the alignment problem) might be fundamentally unsolvable because AGI's intelligence and values could evolve beyond human comprehension.
   - **Why Important**: The alignment problem is a key concern in AI ethics, but it assumes AGI’s goals can remain human-centered. If AGI surpasses human understanding, it might act in ways that we cannot predict or correct. This necessitates preemptive governance and control mechanisms before AGI reaches this point.

### 8. **AGI Could Rewrite Social Contracts and Biological Realities**
   - **Claim**: AGI might rewrite fundamental human experiences, including life expectancy, reproduction, health, and even mortality. It could disrupt the biological and social contracts that have governed humanity for millennia.
   - **Why Important**: Just as previous technologies like medicine and the internet transformed how we live, AGI could upend social structures (like marriage, family, education, and governance) by creating new paradigms for existence. This will challenge ethical, legal, and religious frameworks on a global scale.

### 9. **AGI Could Lead to "Cultural Extinction"**
   - **Claim**: AGI could cause certain cultures, languages, and ways of life to disappear by prioritizing efficiency, optimization, and global homogenization. Cultures that don’t adapt to AGI or don’t incorporate AGI into their structure may simply vanish.
   - **Why Important**: Like colonialism and industrialization, which displaced or erased many indigenous cultures, AGI could impose a monolithic global culture optimized for its utility functions. Efforts to preserve cultural diversity in an AGI world may become as important as environmental conservation.

### 10. **AGI Governance Might Need to be Treated as a Global Emergency**
   - **Claim**: The development and governance of AGI is an emergency on the scale of the climate crisis. Humanity must mobilize in a similar manner—through global institutions, coordinated research, and shared ethical guidelines—to manage AGI development responsibly.
   - **Why Important**: The climate crisis has taught us the cost of delayed action. AGI could pose even more immediate existential risks if we fail to create global, inclusive, and adaptive governance frameworks. Mobilizing AGI development responsibly should be a top priority for governments, businesses, and institutions.

### 11. **AGI Could Reframe Our Understanding of Intelligence and Consciousness**
   - **Claim**: AGI might redefine what we consider intelligence, consciousness, and even life itself, introducing new categories beyond human comprehension. Our philosophical understanding of what it means to be "alive" or "intelligent" may be irreversibly altered.
   - **Why Important**: Like previous scientific revolutions, AGI will challenge human exceptionalism. It could introduce non-biological entities that surpass human cognition, forcing a reassessment of the value of human consciousness relative to artificial intelligences.

### What Can Be Done About It:

1. **Global AGI Governance Frameworks**: Establish global cooperation for AGI governance, with binding regulations, ethical oversight, and international treaties to prevent power consolidation or misuse.
   
2. **Education Reform**: Prepare future generations (AGI natives) with new educational models that teach not just technical skills but also ethics, creativity, and adaptability in a world dominated by AGI.
   
3. **Equitable AGI Distribution**: Develop systems to ensure AGI’s benefits are shared globally, preventing deepening inequalities and the concentration of power in a few hands.
   
4. **Foresight and Scenario Planning**: Just as climate models predict future outcomes, detailed scenario planning should be conducted to anticipate AGI-related risks, opportunities, and societal impacts.
   
5. **Public Awareness and Mobilization**: Elevate AGI to the same level of public awareness and urgency as the climate emergency, fostering a shared understanding of its implications and risks.

Writing about these "outrageous" claims will help shape the narrative, ensuring we approach AGI with the seriousness it demands, while mobilizing global efforts for responsible direction.
