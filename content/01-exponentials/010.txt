The Exponential March of Technology

Imagine, for a moment, that you're standing at the foot of a mountain. You take a step forward. Then another. And another. Your progress is steady, predictable. Now imagine that with each step, your stride doubles in length. Suddenly, what seemed like a long journey becomes a rapid ascent. This, in essence, is the story of technological progress in our time.

Welcome to the age of exponentials, where things don't just get faster – they get faster faster. Where costs don't merely decrease – they plummet at an accelerating rate. This isn't science fiction; it's the reality we're living in, particularly in the realm of computing and artificial intelligence.

Take a look at the graphs before you. The first shows the computational capacity of the fastest supercomputers over time. In 1993, the most powerful machines could perform about 100,000 floating-point operations per second. Fast forward to 2015, and we're talking about machines that can handle over 100 million such operations. It's not a gentle slope – it's a near-vertical climb.

Now shift your gaze to the second graph. It tells an equally compelling story, but in reverse. The cost of computer memory and storage has been in freefall for decades. What once cost millions of dollars can now be had for pocket change. This isn't just progress; it's a revolution in accessibility.

This breathtaking pace of advancement is underpinned by principles like Moore's Law, which observed that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles about every two years, while the cost halves. But it's more than just an interesting factoid for tech enthusiasts. This exponential growth is the engine driving the AI revolution we're witnessing today.

Consider this: each new AI model isn't just incrementally better than the last – it's often dramatically more capable and, counterintuitively, less expensive to run. It's the only industry where this year's model outperforms last year's while costing less. The implications are staggering.

But here's the rub: our brains aren't wired to intuitively grasp exponential change. We're linear thinkers in an exponential world. This mismatch between our perception and reality leads to what we call "exponential slope blindness." We consistently underestimate the pace and impact of technological change.

This blindness isn't just a quirk of human psychology – it has real-world consequences. It's why businesses are caught off guard by disruptive technologies. It's why policymakers struggle to regulate emerging fields like AI. And it's why many of us find ourselves marveling at capabilities that seemed like science fiction just a few years ago.

As we embark on this exploration of AI and its exponential growth, keep this principle in mind: what seems impossible today may well be commonplace tomorrow. The future isn't approaching us at a steady pace – it's racing towards us at an ever-accelerating clip.

In the chapters that follow, we'll delve deeper into the implications of this exponential growth. We'll explore how it's reshaping industries, redefining what's possible, and challenging our very notions of intelligence and creativity. But for now, take a moment to absorb the gravity of where we stand. We're not just witnessing history – we're riding the steepest part of the curve into a future that's arriving faster than we can imagine.

Buckle up. The exponential age is just getting started.

## Exponentials 

Everything is accelerating. We're experiencing unprecedented technological growth, most notably in AI. Moore's Law and other exponential trends are rapidly expanding the boundaries of what's possible.

Exponentials create a mismatch between our perception of change and reality. We think linearly, but technology advances exponentially. This leads to capabilities seemingly exploding overnight, often catching us off guard.

Consider the progress in image generation models over the past year. What was once novel is now approaching photorealism. Language models are on a similar trajectory. The implications are profound.

As leaders and individuals, we must constantly recalibrate our expectations. Today's impossibilities may become tomorrow's norm. Staying ahead requires immersion in these technologies, relentless experimentation, and forward thinking.

This chapter explores exponential growth in AI, its impact on industries, and its implications for our future. The only certainty is that change will continue to accelerate.
