# Everything We Make
## How Technology Shapes Our Reality

Picture this: A Sumerian scribe, painstakingly etching cuneiform characters into a clay tablet. Fast forward a few millennia, and you'll find me, tapping away on a sleek e-reader, consuming entire libraries with a swipe of my finger. What connects these two moments, separated by thousands of years? The inexorable march of technology.

Now, you might be thinking, "Sure, we've made progress, but is there really a 'direction' to all this?" Let me assure you, there absolutely is. And it's hiding in plain sight.

Consider the first set of images in our technology triptych. We start with ancient cuneiform, move through the advent of the printing press, and end up at the digital age. This isn't just a random assortment of communication methods. It's a clear progression towards greater ubiquity and complexity. Each step makes information more accessible, more portable, and more integrated into our daily lives.

But here's the kicker: this progression isn't just about making things easier or more efficient. It's fundamentally altering our expectations of how the world works.

Let's jump to our second set of images. On one side, we have a prehistoric cave painting depicting a hunt. On the other, a modern food delivery rider zipping through city streets. Both images are about acquiring food, but the contrast couldn't be starker.

Our cave-dwelling ancestors would have spent days tracking and hunting their prey. The idea of summoning a meal with a few taps on a glowing rectangle would have seemed like sorcery to them. Yet for us, it's Tuesday night.

This shift in expectations is the true power of technological progress. We've gone from "How do we find food?" to "Why isn't my burger here yet?" in the blink of an evolutionary eye. Technology hasn't just changed what we do; it's changed what we expect to be able to do.

But wait, there's more. (There's always more, isn't there?)

Our final set of images drives home a crucial point: technology isn't just the gadgets and gizmos we use. It's everything we make. From the coins we mint to the crops we cultivate, from the fires we kindle to the words we write – it's all technology.

This realization is both profound and a bit unsettling. It means that every aspect of our lives, every tool we use, every system we rely on, is part of this grand technological narrative. We're not just users of technology; we're co-creators in its ongoing story.

So, what does all this mean for us, standing on the cusp of artificial general intelligence?

Well, for starters, it means we need to be acutely aware of the trajectory we're on. The path from cuneiform to Kindles wasn't inevitable – it was the result of countless decisions, innovations, and adaptations. As we move forward into the age of AI, we're making similar choices that will shape the future in ways we can barely imagine.

It also means we need to be mindful of how these advancements are changing our expectations. Just as we now expect instant access to information and on-demand everything, what will we come to expect from AI? And how will those expectations shape our society, our relationships, our very concept of what it means to be human?

Finally, it reminds us that technology isn't something separate from us. It's a fundamental part of who we are as a species. We are tool-makers, problem-solvers, innovators. The challenge – and the opportunity – is to guide this inherent drive in directions that enhance our humanity rather than diminish it.

As we stand at this technological crossroads, let's remember: the future isn't something that just happens to us. It's something we create, one innovation at a time. And in the grand tapestry of human progress, AI might just be our most transformative thread yet.

So the next time you tap your phone to order dinner, take a moment to marvel at the incredible journey that brought us here. And then, perhaps, spare a thought for where we might be headed next. Because in the end, the most profound changes are often the ones we don't see coming – until they're already here.
