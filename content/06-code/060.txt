* Prototyping and piloting new ideas with GenAI.
* Software is another language which GenAI excels at.
* Foundational skill to understand how AI develops from here.




Here's a brief intro and overview for chapter 6 on code, written in your style:

Code

Programming is language. How to develop using LLMs. This is the next step after generative creation, and it's transforming the landscape of software development.

The key insight here is that compilation is validation. Unlike natural language, where anything can be a poem, code either works or it doesn't. This makes it an ideal domain for AI, which excels at following rules and patterns.

LLMs are remarkably good at generating code. As a non-programmer, I've experienced this firsthand. Building a web app from scratch over a weekend - something that would have been impossible for me before - is now achievable with the help of AI. It's a paradigm shift in what's possible.

But you can't take the thinking out of programming. While AI can generate code, understanding what you want to build and how to break it down into manageable chunks is still crucial. You need to know about 20% of what's being done, while the LLM provides the other 80%.

The approach I call "chunking" is essential. Don't ask LLMs to create large segments of code. Instead, plan out your approach and build in very small steps. Start with an abstract overview, create a detailed plan, then implement piece by piece.

This chapter will explore practical approaches to coding with AI, from using tools like GitHub Copilot to leveraging ChatGPT for full-stack development. We'll look at the strengths and limitations of current tools, and consider how this might evolve in the near future.

Remember, the ecosystem is rapidly improving. Tools that allow you to input loose specifications and generate rough apps are emerging. These will only get better, potentially revolutionizing how we approach software development.

I don’t know about you, but I spent my weekend developing an interactive web app from scratch. It’s worth mentioning that I don’t code. I tried learning assorted languages over the years but something about writing the code never clicked, so in practical terms I’m always left negotiating with developers rather than just building what I want. All of this changed after lunch on Saturday when I decided to implement something I’ve always wanted to build – an AI-based Tarot reading app – as an actual, working, webpage.

It is nothing short of mind-blowing what it feels like to build with ChatGPT. Transformative doesn’t really begin to describe what it’s like to have a limitless assistant helping you do anything.

You have to be mindful of the size of chunks you are asking GPT to build. I made the mistake of starting with an ambitious request, and quickly realized the confident-but-wrong approach ChatGPT is known for also applies to code.

After a while you start getting the hang of how what is work asking, and how to build complexity in modules. Chunking your requests becomes second nature and you quickly realize Chat can be used to answer any question. Something isn’t working? Short of ideas of what to do next? Copywriting? Images? Troubleshooting? ChatGPT has your back.

The app is fully functional but isn’t quite ready to share, and it’s hard to convey how profound this shift feels to me. You no longer need anyone to help you do any of these things anymore. To me that meant spending the weekend intensely coding and making something work.

I have no idea how you will spend your time differently moving forward, but strongly advice investing $20 on ChatGPT Plus and investing as much attention as possible wrangling these tools to start understanding what remains.
