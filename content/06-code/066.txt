# Practical Tips for Generating Code

- reverse-engineer something you like
- finish debugging one feature before starting to build another
- Learn enough to know which questions to ask
- restart often - go back and do again and again using different approaches until it works
- ask for something smaller until it works
- Few things work upfront (but it happens!)
- Compare use different models
- finish debugging one task before starting another
- look out for changes in amount of lines when generating new code.
- always learn from what the model is doing
- log as much as possible, to learn what is being done
- small increments â†’ commit often so you have somewhere to go back to 
- Copy existing instructions into prompt when necessary (like when integrating a plugin)
- Tech specs and file structure overview.
