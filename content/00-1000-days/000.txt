# Field Notes from a Centaur
## Learnings from one thousand days using AI.

This is not a book about artificial intelligence. It is a book about what thinking feels like when it’s shared.

For more than a thousand days, I have used AI every day — to write, design, plan, decide, and think.

At first it was curiosity, then habit, and eventually, collaboration. Somewhere along the way, it stopped feeling like a tool and began to feel like a companion to thought — a second intelligence sitting quietly beside me.

This book is a record of that relationship. It isn’t about technology in the abstract. It’s about what happens when intelligence becomes plural — when we work, reason, and imagine with something that thinks differently.

Over time, I began to see myself less as a user and more as a centaur: half intuition, half computation. The centaur isn’t a metaphor for dependence, but for synthesis. It describes the moment when we stop asking whether machines can think, and start noticing how thinking itself changes in their presence.

The pages that follow are not instructions or opinions. They are field notes from a life spent alongside AI. Each entry describes a way it has entered daily work — writing, building, deciding, or simply being. Together they form a picture of hybrid intelligence: how it feels, how it learns, and how it reshapes the boundaries of human thought.
