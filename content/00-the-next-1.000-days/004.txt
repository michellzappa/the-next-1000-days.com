# Strategic Understanding vs. Technical Knowledge

Every company is and every organization is having to develop a strategy for how to manage their own transition and transformation and everywhere I look everyone I talk to for the last, easily for the last year, has been enamored with and sort of swept up by the amount of change happening in this space

It's not just hype, it's a lot of practical application and that's really what I want to emphasize today

And in many ways the ideal audience for this lecture is someone who's somewhat technical and somewhat practical but not necessarily an expert on either of those axes

So in other words there are much better places to go deep on the specific technologies of AI

This will be looking at the field from a generalist perspective but will go deep in terms of application, right? It's supposed to be useful.

I think there are many important long-term implications of the of these technologies that we'll have to deal with and I hope they reflect it in the session today but ultimately it's about what are the things we can do right now and how can we change our approach to the tools you know and to the processes or responsibilities that we have mainly as leaders but also as sort of humans, individuals, people.






I think it has as we'll see there's a lot going on and I've been trying to make sense of what's going on through this weekly newsletter where I try to sort of translate what I'm learning through interviews, papers, deep dives and into a somewhat coherent format where every week we go over some of these insights and then share that with a small but growing community of like-minded people and this has been a blast
This has been one of the most fun things I've done and I think many of the learnings from the newsletters underpins the content of what we'll be looking at here today so they're inseparable
And I figured this is almost for everyone who's interested in the AI space and is working in it
So there's this intersection of curiosity with actual practice which I think is key to occupy the space properly
We know there's tremendous interest in AI
