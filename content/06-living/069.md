# Medical Research Understanding

When exploring symptoms or medical terms, I use AI to translate technical language into plain explanations. It clarifies anatomy, physiology, and treatment logic before I consult a doctor. This improves comprehension and conversation during real consultations.

#### Replace — Health Triage (N-116)

While traveling without access to a dentist, I used an AI with a long context window to track symptoms and propose a likely diagnosis. A later dental visit confirmed it. Contextual memory supported a high‑stakes personal decision without replacing care.

Responsible note: always consult qualified professionals. Use AI to prepare, track, and understand—not to self‑treat.
