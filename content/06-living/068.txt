This gets very technical very quickly. I'm trying to focus on the high-level observations that are more shareable and that I think will apply in other spaces as well. Maybe we won't even have to code. There are two very recent, very cool examples of drawing things up either in TL Draw with something called "Make Real" or Vercel with something called "v0," where you input a prompt or a wireframe, and it generates workable, usable code for you. This is completely changing the way we interact and build apps. They don't do this on their own; there are attempts at having more autonomous coding systems, and we'll look at that later.
