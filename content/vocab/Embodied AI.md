title: "Embodied AI"
summary: "Integration of AI into physical entities, enabling these systems to interact with the real world through sensory inputs and actions."

Embodied AI represents a paradigm in robotics and artificial intelligence where the AI system is given a physical form, such as a robot, to enable direct interaction with the environment. This approach is grounded in the idea that intelligence emerges not just from processing information but also from the ability to physically engage with and learn from the environment. Embodied AI systems leverage sensors for perception (e.g., vision, touch) and actuators to execute actions (e.g., moving, manipulating objects), aiming to perform tasks ranging from navigation to complex problem-solving in real-world scenarios. The significance of embodied AI lies in its potential to bridge the gap between digital computation and physical action, enabling robots and other physical systems to adapt, learn, and optimize their behaviors in dynamic environments.

Historical overview: The concept of embodied AI began to gain traction in the late 20th century, with notable developments in the 1990s as researchers explored how physical embodiment could influence artificial intelligence and robotics.

Key contributors: Rodney Brooks, a roboticist and former director of the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), is one of the key figures in the development of embodied AI. He advocated for building intelligent robots that could learn from their interactions with the world, a departure from the purely computational approach that dominated AI research at the time.
