title: "Wait Calculation"
summary: "Assessing whether to proceed with projects immediately or wait for future advancements in AI that could offer significant benefits."
---
The concept of Wait Calculation is crucial in the context of AI development and application. It entails a strategic evaluation of the pace of AI advancements against the immediate benefits of using current technologies. Decision-makers weigh the potential improvements in efficiency, effectiveness, and innovation that future AI technologies might bring against the costs and risks of delaying projects. This process is particularly relevant in fast-evolving fields like AI, where the capabilities of new models and techniques can rapidly outpace existing ones, thereby affecting project outcomes and strategic advantages.

Historical Overview: The term and its strategic application have become more relevant with the rapid evolution of AI technologies, particularly post-2010, as advancements in machine learning, neural networks, and AI applications have accelerated. The concept underscores a broader strategic planning approach in technology adoption and project management, especially as organizations grapple with the pace of technological change.

Key Contributors: While the term "Wait Calculation" may not be attributed to specific individuals, it reflects a collective understanding among strategists, technologists, and business leaders about the importance of timing in leveraging technological advancements. Organizations and researchers that closely monitor and analyze AI development trends, such as OpenAI, DeepMind, and various academic institutions, contribute to the broader discourse around strategic planning in the context of AI advancements.

For a practical illustration, Pittsburgh International Airport's implementation of an AI system to calculate wait times for security checks demonstrates a direct application of AI to improve operational efficiency and customer experience. This example highlights how AI can be applied to solve specific problems, offering a glimpse into the broader considerations of deploying AI solutions in real-world scenarios
