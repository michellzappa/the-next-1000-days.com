A fabrication facility, commonly referred to as a fab, is a highly specialized factory where semiconductor devices, such as microchips, are manufactured. These facilities are characterized by ultra-clean environments necessary to avoid any contamination that could interfere with the microscopic manufacturing processes. The production involves complex photolithography to etch integrated circuits onto silicon wafers, a process that demands precise control of numerous variables including temperature, humidity, and contamination. Fabs are pivotal in the technology sector, influencing the capabilities and production cost of electronic devices ranging from simple sensors to advanced computing systems.

Historical overview: The concept of a semiconductor fabrication plant has been central to the electronics industry since the first semiconductor devices were manufactured in the 1950s. However, the term "fab" became more commonly used with the widespread commercialization of integrated circuits in the 1960s and 1970s.

Key contributors: While many companies and individuals have contributed to the development of fab technology, significant early contributions came from pioneers like Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce, who were instrumental in the invention of the integrated circuit. Major semiconductor companies like Intel, Samsung, and TSMC have played crucial roles in advancing fab technologies, driving innovations that reduce the size and cost of microchips while increasing their power and functionality.
