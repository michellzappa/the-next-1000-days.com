title: "Red Teaming"
summary: "Practice where a team independently challenges a system, project, or policy to identify vulnerabilities, improve security, and test the effectiveness of defenses, often applied in cybersecurity and, increasingly, in AI safety and ethics."

Red teaming in AI involves creating scenarios or employing techniques that simulate attacks or challenging conditions on AI systems to evaluate their robustness, security, and ethical integrity. This practice is critical for identifying and mitigating potential vulnerabilities in AI systems before they are exploited maliciously or result in unintended harm. It includes a broad range of activities, from penetration testing and vulnerability scanning to ethical hacking and scenario-based testing. Red teaming helps organizations anticipate and prepare for adversarial attacks, improve system designs, and ensure AI applications align with ethical standards and societal values, thereby enhancing trust in AI technologies.

Historical overview: While the concept of red teaming originates from military strategy and cybersecurity, its application to AI is relatively recent, gaining traction over the last decade as AI systems have become more complex and their implications more significant.

Key contributors: The development and implementation of red teaming in the context of AI do not attribute to single individuals but rather to organizations and research groups focusing on cybersecurity, AI safety, and ethics. Notable institutions like OpenAI, DeepMind, and various governmental and non-governmental organizations have contributed to the evolution and application of red teaming principles in AI.
