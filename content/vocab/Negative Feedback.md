title: "Negative Feedback"
summary: "Control mechanism where the output of a system is fed back into the system in a way that counteracts fluctuations from a setpoint, thereby promoting stability."

In the context of artificial intelligence and machine learning, negative feedback is crucial for algorithms that adapt and learn over time. It plays a significant role in reinforcement learning and other adaptive systems, where the feedback loop is used to adjust parameters in the opposite direction of the deviation from a desired outcome. This mechanism helps in minimizing errors and optimizing the performance of algorithms. It is akin to the way biological systems maintain homeostasis and has been applied in AI to create systems that can adjust their behavior based on the outcomes of their actions, leading to more stable and accurate learning processes.

Historical overview: The concept of negative feedback has roots in control theory and cybernetics, with formal articulation occurring in the early 20th century. Its application in computers and AI systems began to gain prominence in the latter half of the 20th century, as researchers explored ways to make machines adapt to their environment and learn from their actions.

Key contributors: Norbert Wiener, a mathematician and philosopher, was a pioneer in the field of cybernetics, which laid the groundwork for the use of feedback loops in computing and AI. Additionally, the development of reinforcement learning algorithms by Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto in the late 20th century significantly advanced the application of negative feedback principles in AI systems.
