title: Performance Degradation
summary: Decline in the efficiency or effectiveness of an AI system over time or under specific conditions, leading to reduced accuracy, speed, or reliability.

**Detailed Explanation:** Performance degradation in AI systems can occur due to various factors, such as changes in the input data distribution (data drift), increased computational demands, hardware wear and tear, or the system's inability to generalize well to new, unseen data. This phenomenon is critical because it affects the long-term viability and robustness of AI applications, necessitating regular monitoring, maintenance, and updates to the model or infrastructure. In machine learning, performance degradation is particularly problematic when models are deployed in dynamic environments where the real-world data continuously evolves, making it essential to implement strategies like continuous learning, model retraining, and anomaly detection to mitigate the effects.

**Historical Overview:** The concept of performance degradation has been recognized since the early days of computing, with more formal acknowledgment in the context of AI and machine learning emerging in the 1980s and 1990s. As AI systems became more complex and widely used in various applications, the importance of addressing performance degradation became more prominent, especially in the 2000s with the rise of big data and continual deployment of AI in production environments.

**Key Contributors:** The development of strategies to counter performance degradation has involved contributions from various researchers and practitioners in AI and machine learning. Notable figures include Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, and Andrew Ng, who have worked on robust machine learning models and techniques like regularization and transfer learning to address this issue. Additionally, companies like Google, IBM, and Microsoft have developed frameworks and tools to monitor and maintain AI performance in real-world applications.
