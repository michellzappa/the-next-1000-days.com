Multimodal Large Language Models represent a significant evolution in the field of AI, where the integration of multiple data types—such as text, images, audio, and sometimes video—enables these models to perform a wide range of tasks that require a comprehensive understanding of the world in various formats. Unlike traditional language models that process only text, MLLMs can, for example, generate a textual description of an image, answer questions based on a combination of text and images, or even create images from textual descriptions. This capability stems from their deep learning architecture, which is trained on large datasets containing diverse modalities, allowing them to capture the nuanced relationships between different forms of data. MLLMs are paving the way for more intuitive human-computer interactions, enhancing accessibility, and opening new avenues for content creation and information retrieval.

Historical overview: The concept of multimodal learning has been explored since the early 2000s, but the specific term "Multimodal Large Language Models" and their widespread application have gained momentum in the late 2010s and early 2020s, following the success of unimodal large language models like GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) and advancements in deep learning and computational power.

Key contributors: The development of MLLMs has been a collaborative effort involving researchers from both academia and industry, with notable contributions from organizations like OpenAI, Google, and Facebook. These teams have worked on various aspects of MLLM, including architecture design, training methods, and applications, significantly advancing the state of the art in AI.
