**Detailed Explanation:** In AI and related fields, parametric matrix models involve matrices where the elements are defined as functions of a set of parameters. These models are particularly useful in contexts where one needs to capture relationships or transformations that depend on underlying variables, such as in statistical learning, linear regression, or systems identification. The parameters can be tuned or learned from data, allowing the model to adapt to specific scenarios or datasets. In machine learning, such models can be applied to tasks like dimensionality reduction, where matrices parameterized by latent variables are optimized to best represent data with fewer dimensions. In signal processing, parametric matrix models are employed to model and predict the behavior of dynamic systems.

**Historical Overview:** The concept of parametric matrices emerged alongside developments in linear algebra and matrix theory, which have been foundational in mathematics for centuries. The specific application of parametric matrix models in machine learning and AI became more prominent in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, coinciding with advancements in computational power and data-driven modeling techniques.

**Key Contributors:** Important contributions to the development and application of parametric matrix models come from figures in linear algebra and systems theory, such as Richard Bellman, who worked on dynamic programming and matrix equations, and Gene H. Golub, known for his work in numerical analysis and matrix computations. In machine learning, figures like Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun have popularized the use of matrix-based models in neural networks and deep learning.
