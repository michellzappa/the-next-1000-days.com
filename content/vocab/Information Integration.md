---
Detailed Explanation:
Information integration involves merging data from disparate sources to create a cohesive, comprehensive view, which is essential for informed decision-making in various fields, such as business intelligence, healthcare, and scientific research. This process often entails dealing with heterogeneous data formats, schemas, and structures, requiring sophisticated techniques to ensure data consistency, quality, and relevance. Key methods include schema matching, data cleaning, and transformation, which help in resolving conflicts and redundancies. Information integration is crucial for creating data warehouses, enabling data mining, and facilitating real-time analytics by providing a single, unified source of truth.

Historical Overview:
The concept of information integration began to take shape in the early 1980s with the advent of relational databases and data warehousing. It gained significant traction in the 1990s with the rise of enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and the need for comprehensive business intelligence solutions. The term became increasingly popular with the growth of big data and the need to integrate diverse data sources, including unstructured data, in the 2000s and beyond.

Key Contributors:
Significant contributions to the field have been made by researchers and organizations such as Hector Garcia-Molina and Alon Halevy, who have worked extensively on data integration systems and methodologies. Companies like IBM, Oracle, and Microsoft have also played pivotal roles by developing advanced integration tools and platforms that support large-scale data integration initiatives.
