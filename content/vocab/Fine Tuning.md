title: "Fine Tuning"
summary: "Method used in ML to adjust the parameters of an already trained model to improve its accuracy on a specific, often smaller, dataset."

Fine tuning involves taking a pre-trained model, which has been trained on a large, general dataset, and continuing the training process on a new dataset that is typically much smaller and specific to a particular task or domain. This technique leverages the learned features and knowledge of the original model, applying it to a new but related problem. The process often involves adjusting the learning rate to prevent the rapid loss of the pre-trained model's valuable information and may include modifying or expanding the model architecture to better suit the new task. Fine tuning is particularly valuable in scenarios where data is scarce, as it allows for the transfer of knowledge from large, comprehensive datasets to niche applications, enhancing performance without the need for extensive training from scratch.

Historical overview: The concept of fine tuning became prevalent with the rise of deep learning and the availability of large pre-trained models in the early 2010s. It was significantly influenced by the success of transfer learning techniques in computer vision and natural language processing tasks.

Key contributors: While it's challenging to attribute the concept of fine tuning to specific individuals due to its development being closely tied to the broader advancements in machine learning and deep learning, researchers at major AI labs and universities have played crucial roles. Teams at Google, Stanford, and other institutions have been pivotal in demonstrating the effectiveness of fine tuning in various applications, contributing to its widespread adoption in the AI community.
