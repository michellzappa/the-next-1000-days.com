Computational Creativity is an interdisciplinary field that merges principles from artificial intelligence, cognitive psychology, philosophy, and the arts. It focuses on designing systems that can perform tasks traditionally associated with human creativity, including the generation of novel ideas, problem-solving in innovative ways, and the creation of artistic expressions like poetry, visual arts, and music. This area of research is significant not only for advancing our understanding of AI's potential to emulate and augment human creativity but also for exploring the nature of creativity itself. Systems developed under computational creativity often employ complex algorithms, including machine learning techniques and evolutionary computing, to mimic the divergent thinking patterns associated with the creative process.

Historical overview: The concept of computational creativity began to take shape in the late 20th century, with early discussions and exploratory systems emerging in the 1950s and 1960s. However, it gained significant academic and practical interest in the late 1990s and early 2000s as computational power increased and machine learning algorithms became more sophisticated.

Key contributors: While many researchers have contributed to the field, Margaret Boden is a notable figure for her foundational work in defining the theoretical underpinnings of creativity in artificial intelligence. Simon Colton and Geraint Wiggins have also been instrumental in advancing the computational creativity community, particularly through their work on the development of creative systems and the organization of conferences dedicated to the field.
