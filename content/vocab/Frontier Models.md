title: "Frontier Models"
summary: "The most advanced and powerful AI models currently available, pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities towards achieving general intelligence."
---
Frontier models represent the cutting edge in AI research and development, embodying the latest advancements in machine learning, neural networks, and computational power. These models are characterized by their immense size in terms of parameters, sophisticated architecture, and ability to perform a wide range of tasks with high proficiency, often surpassing human performance in specific domains. They are crucial in the pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), as they demonstrate the potential for machines to learn and adapt across a broad spectrum of tasks, showing advancements in learning efficiency, adaptability, and understanding complex patterns. Frontier models are also at the forefront of discussions regarding AI ethics, governance, and the societal impacts of highly advanced AI systems.

Historical overview: The concept of frontier models has evolved rapidly in the last decade, with significant leaps in model size and capability seen yearly. While the term "frontier models" itself may not have a definitive first use, the rapid progression towards more advanced models has been particularly notable since the early 2010s, with the introduction of large-scale deep learning models.

Key contributors: Many organizations and researchers contribute to the development of frontier models, including OpenAI (with models like GPT-3 and GPT-4), Google DeepMind (with models like AlphaZero and GPT-3.5), and others. These entities have played significant roles in advancing the capabilities and understanding of what is
