**Detailed Explanation:** Fairness-aware machine learning aims to address biases in data and algorithms that can lead to unfair treatment of individuals based on characteristics such as race, gender, age, or socioeconomic status. This field involves techniques to detect, quantify, and mitigate biases, ensuring that machine learning models provide equitable predictions and decisions. Approaches include pre-processing data to remove bias, in-processing methods that modify the learning algorithm to prioritize fairness, and post-processing techniques that adjust the outputs to enhance fairness. This area is crucial in applications like hiring, lending, and criminal justice, where biased outcomes can have significant societal impacts.

**Historical Overview:** The concept of fairness in machine learning gained prominence in the mid-2010s, though discussions on algorithmic bias date back to earlier work in ethics and statistics. The term "fairness-aware machine learning" became more widely recognized around 2016 with the increasing societal impact of AI and the publication of influential research papers.

**Key Contributors:** Significant contributors include Cynthia Dwork, who co-authored foundational work on fairness in classification, and Solon Barocas and Moritz Hardt, who have extensively studied algorithmic bias and fairness. Organizations like the Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in Machine Learning (FAT/ML) community have also played a crucial role in advancing this field.
