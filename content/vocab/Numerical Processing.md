Numerical processing is crucial in AI for dealing with quantitative data, which forms the backbone of many machine learning and deep learning models. It includes a wide range of techniques such as normalization, statistical analysis, feature extraction, and dimensionality reduction, enabling AI systems to efficiently process and learn from large datasets. This capability is fundamental in applications ranging from financial modeling and risk assessment to scientific research and engineering, where the accurate and insightful analysis of numerical data is essential.

Historical overview: The roots of numerical processing in AI can be traced back to the early days of computing and the development of algorithms for numerical analysis in the mid-20th century. However, its significance in the context of AI specifically gained prominence with the advent of machine learning in the 1980s and 1990s, as researchers sought efficient ways to handle increasing volumes of data.

Key contributors: While many researchers have contributed to the field of numerical processing within AI, notable figures include Geoffrey Hinton, Yann LeCun, and Yoshua Bengio, often referred to as the "Godfathers of AI," for their foundational work in deep learning which relies heavily on advanced numerical processing techniques.
