title: Cybernetics
summary: Interdisciplinary study of control and communication in living organisms and machines.

Detailed Explanation: Cybernetics, coined by Norbert Wiener in the 1940s, encompasses the study of regulatory and feedback mechanisms in biological, mechanical, and electronic systems. It examines how systems self-regulate, adapt, and process information, using principles such as feedback loops, stability, and communication. This field has profoundly influenced areas like robotics, artificial intelligence, systems theory, and cognitive science, driving advancements in how we understand and design complex, adaptive systems. Cybernetics integrates knowledge from various disciplines, including biology, computer science, engineering, and philosophy, to explore the parallels and interactions between machines and living organisms.

Historical Overview: The term "cybernetics" was first introduced by Norbert Wiener in 1948 in his book "Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine." The concept gained popularity in the 1950s and 1960s as it became central to discussions about systems theory and automation.

Key Contributors: Norbert Wiener is the most significant figure associated with the development of cybernetics. Other notable contributors include Ross Ashby, known for his work on cybernetic systems and homeostasis; W. Grey Walter, a pioneer in the field of brain-machine interaction; and Heinz von Foerster, who contributed to second-order cybernetics, focusing on the observer's role in systems. Their collective work laid the foundation for modern control theory, artificial intelligence, and systems thinking.
