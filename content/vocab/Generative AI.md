title: Generative AI
summary: Subset of AI technologies that can generate new content, ranging from text and images to music and code, based on learned patterns and data.

Generative AI operates primarily through machine learning models that digest large amounts of data to understand and mimic the underlying patterns and structures of that data. This enables the models to produce new, original outputs that are plausible continuations or creations based on their training data. The most common architectures used in generative AI include Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and transformer-based models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer). These technologies find applications across various domains, such as creating realistic visual and audio media, generating written content, simulating environments for AI training, and innovating in product design.

Historical overview: The concept of generative AI began to take shape with the advent of early neural networks, but it gained significant traction in the 2010s with the introduction of more sophisticated models like GANs in 2014 and the subsequent development of transformers in 2017.

Key contributors: Ian Goodfellow is notably credited with the development of Generative Adversarial Networks, a pivotal technology in the generative AI space. Additionally, researchers at Google, including Ashish Vaswani and his team, played a crucial role with their introduction of the transformer model, which has significantly advanced the capabilities of generative AI systems, especially in natural language processing.
