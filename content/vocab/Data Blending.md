summary: Process of combining data from multiple sources into a single, cohesive dataset for analysis.
---
Data blending involves integrating data from various databases, systems, or formats to create a unified view that enhances the accuracy and depth of data analysis. This process is crucial in analytics, enabling organizations to draw insights from disparate data sources, such as combining sales data from a CRM with financial data from an ERP system. Unlike traditional data integration, which often requires complex ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, data blending can be more flexible and faster, allowing for quick merging of data to respond to business needs. It is particularly valuable in business intelligence (BI) and data analytics for enabling more comprehensive and informed decision-making.

Historical Overview: The term "data blending" began to gain traction around the mid-2010s, coinciding with the rise of self-service analytics tools and platforms that empowered non-technical users to combine and analyze data without extensive IT support.

Key Contributors: Companies such as Tableau and Alteryx have been significant contributors to the popularization and development of data blending techniques. Tableau, in particular, has been instrumental in integrating data blending capabilities within its BI tools, making it accessible to a broader audience of data analysts and business users.
