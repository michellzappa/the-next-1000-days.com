title: "Overhang"
summary: "Disparity between the minimum computation needed for a certain performance level and the actual computation used in training a model, often leading to superior model performance."

Overhang in AI research highlights the computational efficiency, or lack thereof, in training machine learning models. It serves as a metric to evaluate how much additional computation—beyond the minimum necessary—is employed to achieve or exceed a specific performance threshold. This concept is pivotal for understanding the trade-offs between computational costs and performance gains in machine learning models. By analyzing overhang, researchers can identify opportunities for optimization, making AI systems more efficient without compromising on their effectiveness. This is particularly relevant in scenarios where computational resources are limited or where energy efficiency is a priority, such as in embedded systems or mobile applications.
    
Historical Overview: The concept of overhang, while not tied to a specific date of origin, has gained relevance with the increasing complexity and computational demands of modern AI systems. As models have grown in size and sophistication, so has the interest in measuring and optimizing the computational resources they require. The terminology itself may not have a well-documented history, but the underlying principle has been a consideration in computer science and machine learning for several decades.

Key Contributors: There are no specific individuals universally credited with introducing the concept of overhang in AI. Instead, it is a topic that has emerged from the collective efforts of the AI research community, particularly those focused on machine learning efficiency, model optimization, and computational sustainability.
