title: Attestation

summary: Process of verifying the integrity and authenticity of hardware, software, or data.

---

Attestation is a critical security mechanism used to ensure that a system's components, such as software or hardware, have not been tampered with. This process involves generating evidence (usually cryptographic) that can be independently verified by an external party to confirm that the components are in a trusted state. In AI, attestation is particularly important for ensuring the reliability of data inputs and model outputs, maintaining the integrity of the AI pipeline, and preventing malicious activities that could compromise system performance or data privacy. Secure boot processes, remote attestation in cloud environments, and trusted platform modules (TPMs) are some practical implementations of attestation.

  

**Historical overview:** The concept of attestation in computing dates back to the early 2000s with the introduction of trusted computing initiatives, notably by the Trusted Computing Group (TCG) in 2003. The term gained significant traction as cybersecurity concerns grew alongside the proliferation of connected devices and cloud services.

  

**Key contributors:** Key contributors to the development and popularization of attestation include the Trusted Computing Group (TCG), which established foundational standards and practices for trusted computing. Significant individual contributions also came from researchers and engineers working on TPMs and secure enclave technologies, such as those from Intel (SGX) and AMD (SEV).
