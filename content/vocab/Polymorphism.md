title: Polymorphism
summary: Ability of objects to take on many forms, allowing methods to perform differently based on the object that invokes them.

Polymorphism is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that enables a function or a method to process objects differently depending on their class or data type. It is crucial for achieving flexibility and maintainability in software development. Polymorphism allows for the design of interfaces with methods that can be implemented by a wide variety of object types, while also supporting the extension of program functionality without modifying the existing codebase. This principle is implemented through techniques such as method overriding and method overloading, where subclasses can provide specific implementations of methods that are defined in their superclass.

Historical Overview: The concept of polymorphism has been integral to object-oriented programming since its inception in the 1960s, with languages like Simula laying the groundwork. It gained widespread recognition and adoption in the 1980s with the popularity of languages such as C++ and Smalltalk, which provided more sophisticated abstractions and tools to implement polymorphic behavior.

Key Contributors: Key figures in the development of polymorphism include Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard, the creators of Simula, which introduced the basic concepts of object-oriented programming. Alan Kay and his team at Xerox PARC further contributed to the development of this concept with their work on Smalltalk, which emphasized the use of objects and classes, making polymorphism more accessible and applicable.
