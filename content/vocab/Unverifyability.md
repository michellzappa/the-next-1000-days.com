title: Neurogenesis
summary: Process by which new neurons are formed in the brain.
---
Detailed Explanation:
Neurogenesis is a critical aspect of brain plasticity, involving the generation of new neurons from neural stem cells. This process primarily occurs in specific regions of the brain, such as the hippocampus, which is crucial for learning, memory, and emotional regulation. Neurogenesis is influenced by various factors, including environmental stimuli, physical exercise, stress, and aging. Understanding neurogenesis has significant implications for treating neurological diseases, brain injuries, and cognitive disorders, as it offers potential pathways for enhancing brain repair and function.

Historical Overview:
The concept of neurogenesis was first proposed in the early 20th century, but it wasn't until the 1960s that evidence of adult neurogenesis in mammals emerged. The term gained widespread acceptance and popularity in the 1990s, following advances in neuroscientific research and improved imaging techniques that allowed for the observation of new neuron formation in the adult brain.

Key Contributors:
Notable contributors to the field of neurogenesis include Joseph Altman and Gopal Das, who provided early evidence of adult neurogenesis in the 1960s, and Fernando Nottebohm, whose work in the 1980s and 1990s further established the significance of neurogenesis in adult birds and mammals. More recent contributions come from Fred Gage and his colleagues at the Salk Institute, who have significantly advanced our understanding of neurogenesis in the adult human brain.
