**Detailed Explanation:** General Computer Control is a significant capability within the realm of artificial intelligence, where an AI system can operate, manipulate, and interact with diverse computer software environments autonomously. This goes beyond task-specific automation to encompass a generalized, flexible control mechanism. The AI can learn and adapt to various software applications, performing actions such as opening and using different programs, managing files, conducting searches, and executing complex sequences of tasks. This capability is often underpinned by advances in reinforcement learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, enabling the AI to understand and operate within graphical user interfaces and command-line environments alike. Such systems aim to replicate human-like versatility in using computers, leading to more comprehensive automation solutions and improved productivity in environments requiring multifaceted software interactions.

**Historical Overview:** The concept of General Computer Control began emerging in the AI research community in the 1980s as part of efforts to create more autonomous and adaptive systems. It gained notable attention in the 2010s with advancements in machine learning and AI technologies, particularly through the development of general-purpose AI frameworks and the success of models like OpenAI’s GPT series, which showcased significant progress in understanding and generating human-like text.

**Key Contributors:** Pioneers in this field include researchers and organizations such as Alan Turing, whose early work on machine intelligence laid the groundwork, and later groups like OpenAI, DeepMind, and Google's AI research teams. These contributors have significantly advanced the capabilities of AI in handling diverse computer software, pushing the boundaries of what autonomous systems can achieve.
