title: EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
summary: Technique used to analyze data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods, before applying more formal modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in the data preprocessing phase, involving various statistical and graphical techniques to uncover underlying patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions. EDA is not just about generating summary statistics but also about visualizing data distributions, relationships, and trends using plots like histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and pair plots. This process helps data scientists and analysts to understand the data's structure, identify variables of interest, detect outliers, and decide on the appropriate data transformation or modeling strategies. By providing insights that guide the selection of modeling techniques and the tuning of parameters, EDA lays the groundwork for accurate predictive models and robust statistical analyses.

Historical Overview:
The term "Exploratory Data Analysis" was popularized in 1977 by John Tukey, who emphasized the importance of using graphical methods to explore data sets. Tukey's approach revolutionized data analysis by advocating for a more intuitive and flexible exploration of data, moving away from strict, confirmatory statistical methods.

Key Contributors:
John W. Tukey is the most significant figure in the development of EDA. His seminal work, "Exploratory Data Analysis," published in 1977, laid the foundation for this approach. Tukey's contributions to statistics, including the development of techniques like the box plot and stem-and-leaf plot, have had a lasting impact on the field and remain integral to EDA practices today.
