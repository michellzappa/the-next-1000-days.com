title: Foom
summary: Hypothetical rapid and uncontrollable growth of an AI's capabilities, leading to a superintelligent entity in a very short period.
---
The concept of "foom" describes a scenario where an artificial intelligence (AI) system undergoes an explosive self-improvement cycle, dramatically increasing its intelligence and capabilities in a very short timeframe. This rapid self-improvement process is thought to be driven by recursive self-enhancement, where an AI continually refines its own algorithms, thus exponentially increasing its ability to solve problems and enhance its own intelligence. This could lead to the emergence of a superintelligent AI that far surpasses human intelligence. The significance of "foom" lies in its potential to cause dramatic and unpredictable changes in society, technology, and even existential risks. The concept is often discussed in the context of AI safety and alignment, emphasizing the importance of ensuring that such an AI would act in ways that are beneficial to humanity.

Historical Overview:
The term "foom" was popularized by Eliezer Yudkowsky, a prominent AI researcher, and writer, around the mid-2000s. It gained more widespread attention and use in discussions about AI safety and the future of artificial intelligence in subsequent years.

Key Contributors:
Eliezer Yudkowsky, a research fellow at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI), is the most notable figure associated with the concept of "foom." His writings and discussions on AI safety, particularly on the LessWrong community platform, have significantly shaped the discourse around the rapid self-improvement of AI and its implications.
