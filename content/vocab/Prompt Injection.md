title: "Prompt Injection"
summary: "Technique used to manipulate or influence the behavior of AI models by inserting specific commands or cues into the input prompt."
---
Prompt injection exploits the flexibility and responsiveness of AI models, particularly those based on natural language processing, to external inputs. By crafting inputs that contain hidden instructions or subtly guided cues, attackers or users can induce the model to generate outputs that it would normally not produce under standard ethical guidelines or operational constraints. This technique raises significant concerns regarding the security and integrity of AI systems, highlighting the need for robust input validation mechanisms and ethical training practices. It also underscores the complexity of AI interactions, where seemingly innocuous inputs can lead to unexpected or unintended consequences.

Historical overview: While the concept of input manipulation has been around as long as software itself, the specific term "prompt injection" and its widespread recognition became more prominent with the advent of advanced NLP models, particularly those utilizing transformer architectures, around the late 2010s.

Key contributors: There are no single key contributors to the concept of prompt injection; instead, it is a phenomenon that has emerged from the collective exploration of vulnerabilities in NLP models by cybersecurity researchers, ethical hackers, and AI ethicists.
