AI Watchdogs play a critical role in the AI ecosystem by providing oversight, setting standards, and enforcing regulations that govern the use of AI technologies. These entities may be governmental organizations, international bodies, non-profit organizations, or coalitions of stakeholders committed to ensuring that AI technologies do not cause harm, perpetuate biases, invade privacy, or exacerbate social inequalities. By monitoring AI developments, AI Watchdogs help to identify potential ethical and legal issues, promote transparency and accountability, and facilitate discussions among developers, users, and policymakers to guide the responsible evolution of AI technologies.

Historical overview: The concept of an AI Watchdog has become increasingly prominent in the 21st century, particularly as AI technologies have become more advanced and their applications more widespread. The term itself gained popularity in the late 2010s as discussions around the ethical implications of AI and the need for regulation intensified.

Key contributors: While no single individual or group can be credited with the creation of AI Watchdogs, various organizations and coalitions around the world have emerged as leaders in this space. These include governmental bodies like the European Commission's High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence, international organizations such as UNESCO, and non-profit organizations like the Future of Life Institute and the Partnership on AI, which consist of academics, industry leaders, and policy makers working together to address the ethical challenges posed by AI.
