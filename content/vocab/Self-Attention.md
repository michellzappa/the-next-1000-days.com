summary: "Mechanism in neural networks that allows models to weigh the importance of different parts of the input data differently."

Self-attention, a critical component of transformer models, revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) and beyond by enabling models to dynamically focus on different parts of the input sequence when processing each word or subcomponent. Unlike traditional attention mechanisms that require a separate context for each input (such as in sequence-to-sequence models), self-attention computes relevance scores across all parts of the input sequence itself. This allows the model to capture intricate dependencies and relationships within the data, regardless of their positional distances. The self-attention mechanism computes a weighted sum of all input representations, with the weights determined by the similarity between inputs. This approach significantly improves the model's ability to understand and generate language, handle long-range dependencies, and improve parallelization in training, making it foundational for models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers).

The concept of self-attention was introduced and gained prominence with the publication of the transformer model in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. in 2017. This paper marked a pivotal shift away from recurrent and convolutional layers, demonstrating that networks based solely on attention mechanisms could achieve state-of-the-art results in NLP tasks.

Ashish Vaswani and his colleagues at Google are credited with the development and popularization of the self-attention mechanism through their work on the transformer model. Their contribution has profoundly influenced subsequent developments in machine learning and AI, fostering a wave of innovations in models that leverage self-attention for various applications.
