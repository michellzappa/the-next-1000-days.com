title: "Rightsizing"
summary: "Adjusting the computational resources allocated to AI systems to match the workload requirements optimally."

Rightsizing for computing load in AI involves strategically configuring the amount and type of computational resources (such as CPU, GPU, and memory) to meet the specific demands of AI models and applications without underutilizing or overextending resources. This is crucial in AI development and deployment because computational needs can vary significantly based on the complexity of the model, the size of the dataset, the training duration, and the inference needs. Effective rightsizing helps in reducing costs, improving performance, and ensuring sustainability by optimizing power consumption and reducing the environmental impact of large-scale computations.

Historically, the concept of rightsizing emerged prominently as cloud computing evolved in the early 2000s, with its relevance in AI becoming more critical as machine learning and deep learning models became more complex and widespread over the last decade.

Key contributors to the development of sophisticated rightsizing techniques often include major cloud service providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure, which have developed tools and services to facilitate efficient resource management tailored to the needs of AI workloads.
