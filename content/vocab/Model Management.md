title: "Model Management"
summary: "Practices and technologies used to handle various lifecycle stages of machine learning models including development, deployment, monitoring, and maintenance."
---
Model management is crucial in ensuring the effectiveness and efficiency of machine learning models throughout their lifecycle. It involves a variety of practices such as version control, model validation, and performance monitoring, ensuring that the models remain robust, secure, and performant in real-world applications. Key components include tracking changes during model development, managing deployment across different environments, continuously monitoring the performance against metrics like accuracy and speed, and dynamically updating the models in response to new data or changing conditions. Effective model management is foundational for scalable AI solutions, as it facilitates seamless updates and maintenance, ensuring that models deliver consistent value.

Historical overview: The concept of model management gained prominence with the rise of machine learning in the late 2000s and early 2010s, especially as industries started to deploy machine learning models at scale which necessitated systematic management practices.

Key contributors: There isn't a single key figure universally recognized for pioneering model management; rather, it has been developed through the collective efforts of numerous data scientists and engineers across various industries, especially those in tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft that have integrated these practices into their operational frameworks.
