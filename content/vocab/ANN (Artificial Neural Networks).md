Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) represent a foundational framework in artificial intelligence and machine learning, mirroring aspects of human brain structure and function to process information. Comprising interconnected units or nodes (analogous to neurons), these networks execute computations through layers that include input, hidden, and output layers. The connections between these units carry weights that adjust as the network learns from data, employing algorithms to minimize error between actual and predicted outcomes. This enables ANNs to handle complex tasks like pattern recognition, language processing, and decision-making, with applications spanning across fields such as finance, healthcare, and autonomous systems. Their flexibility and capacity for learning from unstructured data make them a pivotal tool in advancing AI technologies.

The concept of ANNs dates back to the 1940s, with the introduction of the McCulloch-Pitts neuron model. However, it wasn't until the 1980s and 1990s, with the development of the backpropagation algorithm and the increase in computational power, that ANNs gained significant popularity in research and practical applications.

- Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts (1943): Introduced the first concept of a simplified brain cell, the McCulloch-Pitts neuron, laying the groundwork for neural network research.
- Frank Rosenblatt (1958): Developed the Perceptron, an early neural network capable of supervised learning.
- Geoffrey Hinton, Yann LeCun, and Yoshua Bengio: Often referred to as the "Godfathers of AI," their work, particularly in deep learning and neural networks, has been instrumental in the modern resurgence and success of ANNs.
