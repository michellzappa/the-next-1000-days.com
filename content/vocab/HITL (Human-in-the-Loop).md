title: "HITL (Human-in-the-Loop)"
summary: "Integration of human judgment into AI systems to improve or guide the decision-making process."

Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) is a framework in artificial intelligence where human input is essential for initiating, modifying, or improving the AI's decision-making process. This approach is particularly significant in scenarios where AI alone cannot guarantee accuracy or ethical considerations are paramount. HITL is used to refine AI models through feedback loops, where humans review, annotate, or validate the AI's output, thus ensuring the AI's decisions are reliable, fair, and aligned with human values. This methodology is crucial in sensitive applications such as healthcare diagnostics, legal decision support systems, and content moderation, where the consequences of errors are significant. It embodies a collaboration between AI and human intelligence to leverage the strengths of both: the scalability and speed of AI with the nuanced understanding and ethical judgment of humans.

The concept of incorporating human judgment into automated systems has been around for decades, but the specific term "Human-in-the-Loop" gained prominence in the AI field in the early 21st century as machine learning applications became more prevalent in various domains.

Identifying key contributors to the HITL framework is challenging because it is a broad concept that has evolved through contributions from multiple disciplines, including computer science, psychology, and human-computer interaction. However, research institutions and tech companies that have pioneered in developing interactive machine learning systems and AI ethics guidelines have played significant roles in advancing the HITL approach.
