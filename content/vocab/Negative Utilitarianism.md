---
Detailed Explanation:
Negative utilitarianism, a branch of utilitarian ethics, suggests that the primary moral obligation is to reduce suffering rather than to increase happiness. This philosophy argues that preventing pain and harm should take precedence over promoting pleasure and well-being. It provides a distinct perspective on moral decision-making, emphasizing the importance of alleviating suffering in situations where choices must be made. In AI ethics, negative utilitarianism can inform approaches to developing and deploying technology, prioritizing the minimization of harm to users and stakeholders, and addressing potential risks and negative impacts of AI systems.

Historical Overview:
The term "negative utilitarianism" first appeared in the mid-20th century, gaining more attention and development in ethical discussions during the 1960s and 1970s. It emerged as a response to perceived shortcomings in classical utilitarianism, particularly regarding its handling of extreme suffering.

Key Contributors:
The concept was notably discussed and developed by philosophers such as Karl Popper, who emphasized the importance of reducing suffering in his work. Other significant figures include David Pearce, who has extensively written on the implications of negative utilitarianism for future technological and ethical considerations.
