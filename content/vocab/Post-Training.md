title: "Post-Training"
summary: "Techniques and adjustments applied to neural networks after their initial training phase to enhance performance, efficiency, or adaptability to new data or tasks."
---
Post-training techniques are critical for refining neural network models to improve their performance on specific tasks or to make them more adaptable to new, unseen data. This phase may include additional training sessions with new datasets (transfer learning), pruning of the network to reduce complexity and improve efficiency, or the application of quantization methods to reduce the model's memory footprint and speed up inference. These techniques are essential for deploying models in resource-constrained environments and for maintaining their relevance over time as new data becomes available. They underscore the dynamic and adaptable nature of neural network models in practical applications.

Historical overview: While the concept of neural networks dates back to the 1940s, the practice of post-training adjustments gained prominence in the 21st century as deep learning became more prevalent and the need for efficient, scalable models became apparent, especially for deployment in production environments.

Key contributors: The development of post-training techniques is a collective effort within the AI research community, involving countless contributors across academia and industry. However, organizations like Google, Facebook, and OpenAI, among others, have been instrumental in advancing and popularizing these techniques through their research and the development of frameworks and tools that facilitate model optimization.
