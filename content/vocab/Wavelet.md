### Detailed Explanation:
Wavelets are crucial in signal processing, allowing for the decomposition of signals into components at various scales. This multi-resolution capability makes wavelets highly effective in analyzing non-stationary signals where frequency components vary over time. Unlike traditional Fourier transforms, which use sinusoidal functions, wavelets use basis functions that can be stretched and translated, enabling detailed time-frequency localization. This adaptability makes wavelets ideal for applications like image compression, denoising, and feature extraction in machine learning, where the preservation of both time and frequency information is vital.

### Historical Overview:
The concept of wavelets dates back to the early 20th century, with significant contributions by Alfred Haar in 1909. However, the term "wavelet" and the systematic development of wavelet theory emerged in the 1980s through the work of engineers, physicists, and mathematicians. The concept gained widespread popularity in the 1990s with the advent of powerful computational tools and the development of discrete wavelet transform algorithms.

### Key Contributors:
Key figures in the development of wavelet theory include Alfred Haar, who introduced the first wavelet basis; Ingrid Daubechies, who developed orthogonal wavelets with compact support; and St√©phane Mallat, who formalized the multi-resolution analysis framework. Their combined efforts have established wavelets as a fundamental tool in both theoretical and applied mathematics.
