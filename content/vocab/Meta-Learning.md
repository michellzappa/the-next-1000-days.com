title: Meta-Learning
summary: Learning to learn involves techniques that enable AI models to learn how to adapt quickly to new tasks with minimal data.

Meta-learning focuses on designing algorithms that improve their learning process over time, acquiring new skills or knowledge from limited information efficiently. This approach is particularly significant in AI because it mirrors human-like learning capabilities, allowing machines to generalize learning from one task to improve performance on unknown tasks. Meta-learning involves three main strategies: model-based, metric-based, and optimization-based approaches, each offering unique mechanisms for adapting learning algorithms. This methodology has profound implications for machine learning, enabling more versatile and adaptive AI systems that can tackle a wide range of tasks with fewer data and less supervision.

Historical overview: The concept of meta-learning emerged in the late 1980s and early 1990s, gaining popularity as researchers sought ways to make AI systems more adaptable and efficient in learning new tasks. Schmidhuber's work in 1987 on a theoretical framework for meta-learning marked a foundational step in this field.

Key contributors: JÃ¼rgen Schmidhuber is a notable figure in the early development of meta-learning, contributing significant theoretical foundations. Other prominent contributors include Yoshua Bengio and his research team, who have explored various aspects of meta-learning, including optimization algorithms and neural network models designed to improve learning efficiency.
