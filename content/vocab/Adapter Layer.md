title: Adapter Layer
summary: Neural network layer used to enable transfer learning by adding small, trainable modules to a pre-trained model, allowing it to adapt to new tasks with minimal additional training.
---
Detailed Explanation:
Adapter layers are specialized components in neural networks that facilitate the fine-tuning of pre-trained models for new tasks. These layers are typically small and introduced between existing layers of a pre-trained model, allowing the model to adapt to new data with only a few additional parameters to train. The primary advantage of adapter layers is their efficiency; they allow the reuse of large pre-trained models without the need for extensive retraining or significant computational resources. Adapter layers work by learning task-specific adjustments while keeping the original model's weights mostly unchanged, which helps in maintaining the benefits of the pre-trained features and reduces the risk of overfitting.

Historical Overview:
The concept of adapter layers gained prominence in the late 2010s, particularly with the rise of transfer learning and the need to efficiently adapt large models like BERT or GPT for specific tasks. This approach became popular due to its ability to leverage pre-trained models effectively while addressing the computational constraints associated with training large neural networks from scratch.

Key Contributors:
Key contributors to the development and popularization of adapter layers include researchers from institutions like Google AI and Microsoft Research. Notable figures include Jacob Devlin, who worked on BERT, and teams involved in developing adapter-based methods for efficient transfer learning in natural language processing. The work by Houlsby et al. (2019) specifically on "Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning for NLP" was pivotal in establishing the importance and utility of adapter layers in the field.
