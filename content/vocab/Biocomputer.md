Detailed Explanation: Biocomputers leverage the principles of molecular biology to execute computational operations. Unlike traditional electronic computers that use silicon-based transistors, biocomputers utilize biological components such as enzymes, nucleic acids, and cells to conduct logic operations, data storage, and data retrieval. This is achieved through biochemical reactions that can mimic the logic gates and circuits found in conventional computers. Biocomputers offer the potential for massively parallel processing and ultra-dense data storage, as biological molecules can perform many operations simultaneously and store information at a molecular level. Applications of biocomputers include medical diagnostics, where they can process complex biological data within the human body, and synthetic biology, where they can be used to create new biological systems and pathways.

Historical Overview: The concept of biocomputing emerged in the 1990s, with early theoretical work and experimental demonstrations. It gained significant attention in 1994 when Leonard Adleman demonstrated the feasibility of using DNA to solve a computational problem, specifically the Hamiltonian path problem, marking a pivotal moment for biocomputers.

Key Contributors: Leonard Adleman, a professor at the University of Southern California, is one of the pioneering figures in the field of biocomputing. His groundbreaking work in the 1990s demonstrated the potential of DNA computing. Other significant contributors include researchers like Ehud Shapiro and colleagues at the Weizmann Institute of Science, who have advanced the development of molecular computing systems and programmable biological devices.
