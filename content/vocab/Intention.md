title: Intention
summary: Planned or desired outcome that an agent aims to achieve through its actions.
---
In the context of artificial intelligence, intention is crucial in defining how intelligent agents interact with their environment to achieve specific goals. It involves the processes that guide decision-making, planning, and execution of actions based on the agent's goals and the constraints of the environment. In AI models, especially those involved in robotics or interactive systems, programming intentions involves creating algorithms that can interpret and prioritize objectives, plan sequences of actions, and adjust strategies dynamically based on feedback from the environment.

Historical overview:
The concept of intention has been discussed philosophically for centuries, but its formalization in AI systems began in earnest with the development of planning and decision-making models in the 1960s. The term became widely recognized in AI through research on goal-oriented behavior and rational agency, gaining prominence with the advent of intelligent agents in the 1980s and 1990s.

Key contributors:
Significant contributions to the understanding and implementation of intention in AI have come from fields like cognitive science, robotics, and computer science. Researchers like John McCarthy, who pioneered the study of artificial intelligence, and Michael Bratman, known for his work on the theory of intention in philosophy, have been influential in shaping how intentions are modeled and understood in AI systems.
