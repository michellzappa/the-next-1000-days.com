title: Exocortex
summary: External artificial extension of the human brain, designed to augment cognitive functions through advanced computing technologies.
---
**Detailed Explanation**: The concept of an exocortex envisions a system where external digital devices, such as neural implants or sophisticated AI, interface directly with the human brain to enhance memory, decision-making, problem-solving, and other cognitive processes. It functions as an "external cortex," supporting the brain by offloading complex computations, storing vast amounts of information, and even providing access to AI-driven insights. This idea has deep implications for human intelligence, potentially blurring the line between biological and artificial thinking, and is tied to transhumanist goals of overcoming cognitive limits through technology. In practice, exocortex systems could integrate with neural networks and brain-machine interfaces, potentially enabling humans to interact more seamlessly with machines and data in real time.

**Historical Overview**: The term "exocortex" first appeared in speculative futurist discussions in the late 1990s and early 2000s. It gained more traction as advances in neurotechnology, AI, and brain-computer interfaces made the possibility of such systems more tangible, particularly in the 2010s with developments in neural implants and AI.

**Key Contributors**: The concept is closely associated with thinkers in the transhumanist movement, such as _Anders Sandberg_ and _David Pearce_, who have explored the augmentation of human cognition through external technologies. Innovators in neurotechnology, like _Elon Musk_ with Neuralink, and researchers in AI, have also contributed significantly to the progress in this area.
