summary: "Systems and methods that enable interactive communication between autonomous agents and computer programs."

Agent-Computer Interface (ACI) is crucial in the development of systems where software agents—programs that perform tasks autonomously—interact with various computer systems and environments. This interface is particularly significant in fields like robotics, where agents need to understand and manipulate their environment, or in software applications, where agents might be used for automated decision-making or data processing. ACI involves the integration of diverse fields such as natural language processing, machine learning, and user interface design to create effective and efficient interactions between agents and computer systems.

Historical overview: The concept of an agent-computer interface became more prominent with the rise of intelligent agents in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The term itself reflects an evolution in thinking about how autonomous systems interface with traditional computing frameworks, highlighting the shift from direct human-computer interaction to mediated interaction through autonomous agents.

Key contributors: While specific key figures in the development of ACI are not well-documented, the field owes much to researchers in artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction, including areas like distributed artificial intelligence (DAI) and multi-agent systems (MAS).
