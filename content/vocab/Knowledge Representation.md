Knowledge Representation is crucial in AI for creating models that can simulate human understanding and reasoning. It encompasses the theories, techniques, and practices used to model the world for machines in a way that they can make sense of it, reason about it, and make decisions based on this understanding. This involves the use of various symbolic and non-symbolic approaches to encode information so that it is accessible and useful for AI processes. Effective knowledge representation enables the system to exhibit intelligent behavior, such as diagnosing problems, understanding natural language, planning, and learning. It relies on logic, ontologies, graphs, and schemas to structure and infer new knowledge, making it a foundational component in developing sophisticated AI systems.

Historical overview: The concept of Knowledge Representation has been central to AI research since its inception in the 1950s and 1960s, evolving significantly over the decades. Its importance was particularly highlighted in the 1970s and 1980s as researchers focused on creating expert systems that required a deep understanding of specific domains.

Key contributors: While many researchers have contributed to the field of Knowledge Representation, notable figures include John McCarthy, who is often credited with founding the field of AI and contributed significantly to formalizing knowledge representation languages, and Marvin Minsky, whose work on frames as a form of knowledge representation has been influential.
