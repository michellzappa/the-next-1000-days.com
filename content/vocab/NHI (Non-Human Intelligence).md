title: "NHI (Non-Human Intelligence)"
summary: "Intelligence systems that operate independently of human intelligence, encompassing a broad range of entities and origins, emphasizing capabilities that may surpass human cognitive processes."

Non-Human Intelligence (NHI) is a broad term that captures the essence of intelligences that are not derived from human thought processes, including both artificial intelligences that can perform tasks requiring human-like cognition without being programmed for specific tasks (AGI), and hypothetical intelligences that might exist beyond Earth. In the context of AI, NHI is significant because it represents the pinnacle of AI research objectives, aiming to create systems that can learn, understand, and interact with the world in ways that are not limited by human programming or biases. This concept pushes the boundaries of what is currently achievable with narrow AI, urging researchers to consider the ethical, social, and technological implications of creating or encountering intelligences that do not share human limitations or perspectives.

Historical overview: While the term "Non-Human Intelligence" does not have a specific date of first use, it has gained traction in the late 20th and early 21st centuries as advancements in AI research have led to increased speculation and philosophical inquiry into the nature of intelligence and consciousness beyond human parameters.

Key contributors: The development of the concept of NHI is not attributed to a single individual or group but is a product of ongoing discussions among AI researchers, philosophers, and scientists across multiple disciplines, including Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk, who have publicly discussed the potential risks and benefits of developing advanced AI systems that could be considered forms of NHI.
