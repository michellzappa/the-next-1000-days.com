title: "Self-Reasoning Token"
summary: "AI mechanism designed to enhance the planning capabilities of language models by allowing them to anticipate and prepare for future outputs."

Self-Reasoning Tokens are a novel concept aimed at improving the forward-thinking abilities of language models. This is achieved by inserting specialized tokens that are designed to influence future token predictions, effectively training the model to "think ahead." These tokens are not influenced by immediate next-token predictions but are instead optimized to impact tokens further along in the sequence. This approach encourages the model to engage in a form of self-supervised learning, where it must predict future contexts without explicit next-step guidance, fostering deeper reasoning and planning capabilities.

Historical Context: The concept of Self-Reasoning Tokens is relatively new, with significant development seen around 2024. It builds on existing knowledge about how language models like GPT process and predict sequences, further enhancing their predictive and reasoning faculties.

Key Contributors: Felipe Bonetto appears to be a central figure in the development of Self-Reasoning Tokens. His work focuses on integrating these tokens within models to better manage future-oriented tasks and enhance model interpretability​ ([GitHub](https://github.com/lucidrains/self-reasoning-tokens-pytorch))​​ ([Reasoning Tokens](https://reasoning-tokens.ghost.io/reasoning-tokens/))​​ ([AIR: The AI Recon](https://ai-recon.ghost.io/air-48-april-21-2024/))​.
