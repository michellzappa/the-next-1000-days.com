title: "Interpretability"
summary: "Extent to which a human can understand the cause of a decision made by an AI system."
---
The significance of interpretability lies in its ability to make AI systems transparent and their decisions understandable to humans, facilitating trust and adoption in various applications. It is especially crucial in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice, where understanding the rationale behind AI decisions is necessary for ethical, legal, and practical reasons. Interpretability techniques can vary from simple, transparent models like decision trees that provide straightforward insights into decision-making processes, to more complex methods aimed at explaining the outputs of opaque models like deep neural networks, through approaches such as feature importance scores, attention mechanisms, or surrogate models.

Historical overview: The concept of interpretability has been around since the early days of AI and machine learning, but it gained significant attention in the 2010s with the rise of complex models that are powerful yet difficult to interpret, such as deep learning.

Key contributors: While many researchers contribute to the field of AI interpretability, there is no single figure or group dominantly recognized across the entire domain. Instead, numerous individuals and research groups across academia and industry are advancing the understanding, methods, and tools for improving the interpretability of AI systems.
