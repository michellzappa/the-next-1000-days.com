Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) are a sophisticated form of AI that combine the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with computer vision technologies to process and understand multimodal inputs—images and text. These models are trained using a variety of techniques, including cross-attention mechanisms, which allow them to fuse visual and textual information effectively. This integration enables them to perform tasks such as image captioning, visual question answering, and text-based image retrieval with high accuracy. The goal is to create models that can understand and generate content that reflects a more holistic grasp of both visual elements and textual narratives, thereby improving the AI's ability to interact in a world where multiple forms of data are always present​ ([Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/blog/vision_language_pretraining))​​ ([ar5iv](https://ar5iv.org/abs/2402.04236))​​ ([ar5iv](https://ar5iv.org/abs/2305.11175))​​ ([OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=EA8dTp96GY))​.

Historical overview: The concept of integrating vision and language in machine learning models has been explored for several years, but significant advancements began to materialize with the rise of transformer-based models around the late 2010s. Models like CLIP and DALL-E by OpenAI, introduced around 2020, have popularized and accelerated the development of LVLMs by demonstrating effective strategies for multimodal learning and generation.

Key contributors: Many of the advancements in LVLMs have been driven by research teams at major tech companies and academic institutions. Notable contributions have come from teams at Google, OpenAI, and various universities, which have developed foundational models like CLIP, DALL-E, and their derivatives. The ongoing research continues to refine these models, enhance their efficiency, and expand their application scopes​ ([Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/blog/vision_language_pretraining))​​ ([ar5iv](https://ar5iv.org/abs/2402.04236))​​ ([OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=EA8dTp96GY))​.
