title: "Parameter Size"
summary: "Count of individual weights in a ML model that are learned from data during training."

In the context of machine learning, particularly in neural networks, parameter size is crucial as it directly influences both the model's capacity to learn complex patterns and its computational efficiency. Each parameter represents a component of the model's internal representation of the data it has learned. Larger parameter sizes generally allow for more nuanced data representations, enabling the model to perform better on complex tasks. However, this comes at the cost of increased memory usage, longer training times, and often a higher risk of overfitting, especially if not countered by sufficient training data or regularization techniques.

Historical Overview: The concept of parameter size became significantly relevant with the rise of deep learning in the early 21st century. As models such as AlexNet in 2012 demonstrated superior performance on tasks like image recognition, the trend towards larger models with millions of parameters became more pronounced.

Key Contributors: While many researchers have contributed to the development and optimization of parameter-efficient models, Geoffrey Hinton, Yann LeCun, and Yoshua Bengio are notable for their foundational work in deep learning which inherently deals with models containing a large number of parameters. Their research during the 1980s and 1990s set the stage for later advancements that would heavily utilize large-scale parameterization to achieve breakthroughs in various AI applications.
