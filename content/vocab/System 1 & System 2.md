title: System 1 & System 2
summary: "Two modes of thinking in human cognition: System 1 is fast, automatic, and intuitive, while System 2 is slow, deliberate, and analytical."
---
Expert-Level Explanation:
System 1 and System 2 are conceptual models introduced by psychologist Daniel Kahneman to describe the dual processes underlying human thought. System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control. It handles everyday tasks, relying on heuristics and instincts that have evolved to quickly assess situations and make decisions. System 2, on the other hand, allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations, conscious deliberation, and logical reasoning. These two systems interact to enable humans to navigate their environments efficiently; System 1 handles routine and rapid judgments, while System 2 steps in for more complex and novel situations where deeper analysis is required. Understanding these systems is crucial in fields such as behavioral economics, cognitive psychology, and artificial intelligence, as it informs how decisions are made and how cognitive biases can affect judgment.

Historical Overview:
The concept of dual-process theory, which System 1 and System 2 fall under, has roots tracing back to the early 20th century, but it was Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky's work in the 1970s and 1980s that significantly developed these ideas. Kahneman's 2011 book "Thinking, Fast and Slow" popularized the terms "System 1" and "System 2," bringing widespread attention to these models of human cognition.

Key Contributors:
Daniel Kahneman is the primary figure associated with the popularization of System 1 and System 2 through his extensive research and his book "Thinking, Fast and Slow." Amos Tversky, Kahneman's collaborator, also played a crucial role in the foundational research that led to these concepts. Their collaborative work on heuristics and biases laid the groundwork for understanding these dual processes.
