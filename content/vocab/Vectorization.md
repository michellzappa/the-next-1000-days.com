title: "Vectorization"
summary: "Process of converting non-numeric data into numeric format so that it can be used by ML algorithms."

Vectorization is a crucial preprocessing step in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) where textual data, images, or other non-numeric data types are transformed into a numerical format, typically vectors of numbers, to be efficiently processed and analyzed by algorithms. This process involves representing the input data in a way that preserves its informational content but in a form that algorithms can work with. For text data, techniques such as one-hot encoding, TF-IDF, and word embeddings are common methods of vectorization, allowing algorithms to understand semantic similarities and relationships between words or documents. For images, vectorization often involves flattening pixel matrices into vectors or extracting feature vectors through methods like convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

The concept of vectorization has been foundational in the development of modern AI, especially in the fields of NLP and computer vision. It allows for the efficient and effective processing of large datasets, enabling machines to "understand" and learn from data in forms natural to humans but not originally suitable for computer algorithms. 

The roots of vectorization as a concept in computing can be traced back to the early days of information retrieval and text processing, gaining prominence with the advent of the internet and the exponential increase in digital text and image data. Although the specific term "vectorization" might not have been used initially, the practice of converting non-numeric data into a numeric form for computation has been a cornerstone in computer science for decades.

Key contributors to the development and refinement of vectorization techniques include researchers in the fields of NLP and computer vision, where significant advancements in algorithms and processing capabilities have continuously evolved the methods and applications of vectorization.
