title: Decomposition
summary: Process of breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts that can be solved individually.

Decomposition is a fundamental concept in computer science and AI, particularly useful in algorithm design, machine learning, and problem-solving. By dividing a problem into subproblems, each can be addressed independently, potentially with different methods suited to each part's specific challenges. This approach not only simplifies the overall problem but can also lead to more efficient and scalable solutions. In AI, decomposition is crucial for tackling tasks ranging from natural language processing and image recognition to complex decision-making systems, where direct approaches would be computationally infeasible or less efficient.

Historical Overview:
The idea of decomposition has been inherent in computational theories since the early days of computer science, gaining prominence with the development of structured programming in the 1960s and 1970s. It aligns with the broader principles of divide and conquer algorithms, which have been essential to computer science since its inception.

Key Contributors:
While decomposition as a concept does not have a singular inventor, it has been significantly advanced by figures in the field of computer science like Edsger Dijkstra and Donald Knuth, who emphasized structured programming and modular design. Their work laid the groundwork for the modern applications of decomposition in AI systems.
