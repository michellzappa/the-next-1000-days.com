title: Goal
summary: Desired outcome or objective that an AI system is programmed to achieve.
---
In artificial intelligence, a goal is an essential component that guides decision-making processes within AI systems. Goals can vary widely, from simple tasks like sorting a list of numbers to complex objectives such as driving a car autonomously or managing a stock portfolio. These goals are typically defined in the systemâ€™s programming and influence the algorithms used, shaping the AI's behavior and response patterns. For example, in reinforcement learning, an AI agent learns to make a sequence of decisions to maximize a reward signal that aligns with achieving its goal. In goal-based planning systems, the AI uses predefined goals to evaluate possible actions and predict their outcomes, choosing the path that most likely leads to the goal.

Historical Overview:
The concept of a goal in AI has been fundamental since the field's inception in the 1950s. Early AI research focused on creating systems that could achieve specific, predefined objectives, and the notion of goal-driven behavior became more refined with advancements in areas like expert systems and machine learning.

Key Contributors:
Early AI pioneers such as Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon were instrumental in establishing the importance of goal-driven behavior in AI. Their work in the 1950s and 1960s on programs like the General Problem Solver emphasized the role of goals in intelligent systems. More recently, figures in the development of machine learning and robotics continue to advance the understanding and implementation of complex goals in AI systems.
