title: "Continuous Learning"
summary: "Systems and models that learn incrementally from a stream of data, updating their knowledge without forgetting previous information."

Continuous learning, also known as lifelong learning, addresses one of the major challenges in AI: the ability of a model to adapt to new data over time while retaining previously learned information. This is crucial in dynamic environments where conditions or data distributions change frequently. Continuous learning techniques help mitigate catastrophic forgetting, where a model loses its ability to perform tasks it was previously trained on when new tasks are introduced. These techniques are often implemented through methods such as regularization, rehearsal, and dynamic architecture adjustments, which balance the retention of old knowledge with the acquisition of new information.

Historical overview: The concept of continuous learning emerged prominently in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with growing interest in developing models that mimic human-like learning processes over extended periods.

Key contributors: Significant contributions have come from the fields of neural networks and machine learning, with researchers like Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio exploring various aspects of how neural models can be adapted to learn continuously without forgetting. Additionally, various research institutions and tech companies have dedicated efforts to advance this area, recognizing its potential impact on real-world applications.
