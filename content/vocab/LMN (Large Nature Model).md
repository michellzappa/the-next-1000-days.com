title: "LMN (Large Nature Model)"
summary: "Open-source model focused on nature, using a vast, ethically sourced dataset of natural world elements."
---
The Large Nature Model, conceived by Refik Anadol Studio for the DATALAND project, represents a significant shift in AI's application towards environmental appreciation and understanding. Unlike traditional models that lean heavily on human-generated content, this model is trained exclusively on nature’s vast diversity, encompassing flora, fauna, and fungi, with a notable focus on rainforest ecosystems. This endeavor is pioneering not only in its unique dataset but also in its interdisciplinary approach, merging art, science, and technology to create a holistic view of nature's complexity. The project aims to foster a deeper connection between humanity and the natural world, promoting conservation and sustainable interaction through immersive, data-driven art.

Historical overview: The concept of utilizing AI to interpret and represent nature through art is relatively new, with Anadol's project announced and gaining attention in 2024. This innovative application of AI technology marks a novel exploration of how generative models can be used outside conventional contexts, like language processing or image generation, to enhance environmental awareness and education.

Key contributors: Refik Anadol and his studio are the principal visionaries behind the Large Nature Model, collaborating with institutions such as the Smithsonian, National Geographic, and the Cornell Lab, alongside technological support from Google Cloud and NVIDIA. Anadol's interdisciplinary approach, blending art with cutting-edge technology, positions his work at the forefront of AI's application in environmental and artistic contexts [oai_citation:1,DATALAND](https://dataland.art/) [oai_citation:2,Refik Anadol Launches the World’s First Open-Source A.I.
