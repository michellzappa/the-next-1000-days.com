Connectionist AI, primarily encompassed by neural networks, represents an approach to AI that emphasizes the creation and use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) for processing data and making decisions. Unlike symbolic AI, which relies on explicit rules and logic, connectionist models learn patterns and relationships directly from data. This learning process is inspired by the biological processes of the human brain, where a vast network of neurons fires in response to stimuli, strengthening or weakening connections based on experience. In the context of AI, this translates to algorithms adjusting the weights of connections between artificial neurons during training to minimize error and improve performance on tasks such as classification, prediction, and pattern recognition. Connectionist models are particularly notable for their ability to learn representations of data in an unsupervised manner, making them versatile and powerful tools for a wide range of applications, including speech recognition, image processing, and natural language understanding.

Historical overview: The concept of connectionist AI began to take shape in the 1940s and 1950s with the development of early neural network models. However, it was not until the 1980s and the advent of backpropagation algorithms that connectionist AI gained significant traction and became a central pillar of modern artificial intelligence research and development.

Key contributors: Early pioneers of connectionist AI include Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts, who created the first conceptual model of an artificial neuron in 1943. Donald Hebb introduced Hebbian learning, a fundamental principle in neural network learning, in 1949. Later, key figures such as Geoffrey Hinton, Yann LeCun, and Yoshua Bengio significantly advanced the field by developing and refining algorithms and architectures that underpin today's deep learning revolution.
