title: Manifold Learning
summary: Type of non-linear dimensionality reduction technique used to uncover the underlying structure of high-dimensional data by assuming it lies on a lower-dimensional manifold.

Manifold learning operates on the premise that high-dimensional data can often be represented in a more compact form without significant loss of information, by mapping it onto a lower-dimensional manifold embedded within the higher-dimensional space. This approach is particularly useful for understanding the intrinsic geometry of data, which traditional linear methods like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) might fail to capture. Techniques such as Isomap, Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), and t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) are commonly used manifold learning algorithms. These methods seek to preserve local or global geometric properties of the data, making them powerful tools in fields like computer vision, bioinformatics, and natural language processing, where complex, high-dimensional data is prevalent.

Historical Overview: The concept of manifold learning emerged in the late 1990s and early 2000s, coinciding with advancements in machine learning and computational power that made it feasible to apply these techniques to large datasets. Landmark papers such as "Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction by Locally Linear Embedding" (2000) by Roweis and Saul, and "Global Geometric Frameworks for Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction" (2000) by Tenenbaum, de Silva, and Langford, significantly advanced the field.

Key Contributors: Significant contributions to manifold learning include Sam Roweis and Lawrence Saul for their work on Locally Linear Embedding (LLE), and Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Vin de Silva, and John Langford for developing the Isomap algorithm. Their pioneering research laid the groundwork for subsequent advancements and applications in manifold learning techniques.
