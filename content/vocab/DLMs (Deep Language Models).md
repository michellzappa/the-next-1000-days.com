Deep language models are a subset of natural language processing (NLP) that use deep learning architectures, such as deep neural networks, to process and generate human language. These models are trained on large datasets of text and learn to predict the next word in a sequence, understand the context of a sentence, or generate entirely new sentences. Their ability to model and generate text has led to transformative applications in areas like automated translation, content generation, and conversational AI systems.

The concept of deep language models has been evolving since the early 2000s, but significant advances were made in the 2010s with the development of models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). These models demonstrated unprecedented accuracy in language understanding and generation tasks.

Key contributors to the field include Geoffrey Hinton, known for his work on deep learning, and researchers at Google and OpenAI who developed groundbreaking models such as BERT and GPT, respectively. These contributions have significantly shaped the capabilities and applications of deep language models in the AI field.
