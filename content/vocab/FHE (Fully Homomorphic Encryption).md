title: "FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption)"
summary: "Type of encryption that allows computation on ciphertexts, producing an encrypted result that, when decrypted, matches the result of operations performed on the plaintext."

FHE is a breakthrough in the field of cryptography, allowing for arbitrary computations to be performed on encrypted data without ever needing to decrypt it. This capability is crucial for privacy-preserving data analysis, secure cloud computing, and enhancing the security of AI systems in environments where sensitive data cannot be exposed. It enables the outsourcing of computation tasks to third-party servers while ensuring that the data remains confidential. Despite its potential, FHE has been challenging to implement in practice due to its computational complexity. However, ongoing research is focused on optimizing its efficiency and making it more practical for real-world applications.

Historical overview: The concept of Homomorphic Encryption was first introduced in the late 1970s, but it wasn't until 2009 that Craig Gentry published a dissertation proposing the first viable scheme for Fully Homomorphic Encryption.

Key contributors: Craig Gentry is a central figure in the development of FHE, having proposed the first workable scheme. Since then, numerous researchers in cryptography and computer science have contributed to refining the concept and developing more efficient algorithms to make FHE more practical for use in various applications.
