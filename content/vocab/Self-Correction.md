title: Self-Correction
summary: An AI system's ability to recognize and rectify its own mistakes or errors without external intervention.

**Expert Explanation:** Self-correction in AI involves an iterative process where an AI model evaluates its outputs and adjusts its internal parameters or strategies to improve performance. This capability is crucial for adaptive learning and robustness, enabling models to reduce errors in real time or over repeated tasks. In machine learning, self-correction often arises in the context of reinforcement learning, where agents adjust their actions based on feedback from the environment, or in supervised learning where models minimize loss functions through gradient-based optimization. For example, during training, a neural network modifies its weights after each prediction based on the difference between predicted and actual results, refining its understanding over time. Self-correcting mechanisms are also integral to autonomous systems, like self-driving cars, where continuous adjustments are made to improve safety and efficiency.

**Historical Overview:** The concept of self-correction has been a part of AI research since the early days of machine learning in the 1950s and 60s, with more structured approaches emerging as optimization techniques like gradient descent became widespread in the 1980s. The term gained prominence in the 2000s, particularly with the rise of reinforcement learning and deep learning frameworks.

**Key Contributors:** The development of self-correcting systems is tied to pioneers of learning algorithms, such as Arthur Samuel, who developed early machine learning systems, and John von Neumann, whose work on error-correcting codes contributed to early theories of self-adjustment. More recent contributors include Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto, whose work on reinforcement learning formalized self-correction within dynamic environments.
