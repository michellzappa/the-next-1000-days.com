title: "Hallucination"
summary: "Generation of inaccurate, fabricated, or irrelevant output by a model, not grounded in the input data or reality."

Hallucination in AI systems, particularly in NLP and CV, signifies a critical challenge where models produce outputs that, while seemingly plausible, do not accurately reflect the input data or the real-world context they are supposed to model. This issue is prevalent in generative models, such as those used for text generation or image synthesis, where the model might generate text or images that are unrelated or only loosely related to the given prompts or source material. The phenomenon raises concerns about reliability and trustworthiness, especially in applications requiring high levels of accuracy and adherence to factual content, like news generation, medical imaging analysis, or legal document review. Understanding and mitigating hallucinations is an active area of research, focusing on improving model architecture, training data quality, and post-generation verification processes to ensure outputs are both creative and accurate.

Historical overview: The term "hallucination" began to be more commonly used in the context of AI and machine learning in the late 2010s, as generative models became increasingly capable and their output increasingly complex. The recognition of hallucination as a distinct issue coincided with the broader deployment of AI systems in real-world applications, where the consequences of inaccurate or misleading outputs became more apparent.

Key contributors: The development and identification of hallucination in AI do not attribute to a single individual or group but are rather a collective realization within the AI research community. Efforts to address hallucination involve a wide range of researchers working on machine learning models, particularly those focused on generative models, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and transformer-based models like GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) and BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), where understanding and mitigating such behaviors is crucial for advancing the field.
