The concept of a safety net in AI encompasses a broad range of preventive and corrective strategies intended to safeguard against unintended, unethical, or harmful consequences of AI systems. This includes the development of ethical guidelines, regulatory frameworks, robustness checks, transparency measures, and fail-safe mechanisms. Such safety nets are crucial for ensuring AI systems operate within desired ethical boundaries and for maintaining public trust in AI technologies. They address potential risks such as bias, privacy invasion, security vulnerabilities, and the exacerbation of social inequalities, aiming to guide the development and deployment of AI in a socially responsible manner.

Historical overview: The need for safety nets in AI has become increasingly recognized alongside the rapid advancement and widespread deployment of AI technologies, particularly in the 21st century. As AI systems have grown more complex and integrated into critical sectors like healthcare, finance, and law enforcement, the potential for negative impacts has prompted calls for comprehensive safety and ethical standards.

Key contributors: The development of safety nets in AI involves a wide array of stakeholders, including ethicists, policymakers, researchers, and industry leaders. Organizations such as the Future of Life Institute, OpenAI, and various governmental and international bodies (e.g., European Commissionâ€™s High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence) have played significant roles in proposing frameworks and guidelines to ensure the ethical use of AI.
