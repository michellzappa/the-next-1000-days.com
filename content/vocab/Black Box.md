title: "Black Box"
summary: "System or model whose internal workings are not visible or understandable to the user, only the input and output are known."

The concept of a "black box" in artificial intelligence and machine learning describes models or algorithms that operate without revealing their internal mechanisms or logic to the user. This term is often used to critique complex models like deep neural networks, where the exact process by which inputs are transformed into outputs is opaque, even if the overall performance is high. The black box nature of many AI systems raises challenges for interpretability, trustworthiness, and ethical considerations, as understanding the decision-making process is crucial for debugging, improving models, verifying compliance with regulations, and ensuring fairness. Efforts in explainable AI (XAI) aim to address these challenges by making the models more transparent and their decisions easier to interpret.

The metaphor of the "black box" has been used in science and engineering long before the advent of AI, originally in cybernetics and later in fields like psychology and systems engineering. Its application to AI and machine learning has become more prominent with the rise of complex algorithms in the 21st century, especially deep learning models that have been widely adopted since the 2010s.
