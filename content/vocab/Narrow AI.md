title: Narrow AI
summary: Also known as Weak AI, refers to AI systems designed to perform a specific task or a narrow range of tasks with a high level of proficiency.

Expert-Level Explanation: Narrow AI systems are tailored to handle particular applications such as facial recognition, language translation, or playing chess. Unlike general AI, which aims to understand and perform any intellectual task a human can, Narrow AI focuses on optimization and efficiency within its predefined boundaries. These systems leverage advanced algorithms, machine learning, and data processing techniques to excel in their designated functions but lack the ability to generalize knowledge across different domains or perform tasks outside their training.

Historical Overview: The term "Narrow AI" began to take shape in the early 21st century, as advancements in machine learning and specialized algorithms allowed AI to outperform humans in specific tasks. The concept gained significant traction around the mid-2010s with the proliferation of applications such as virtual assistants (e.g., Siri, Alexa), recommendation systems, and targeted advertising.

Key Contributors: Pioneers in the development of Narrow AI include Alan Turing, who laid the foundational work in artificial intelligence, and John McCarthy, who coined the term "Artificial Intelligence." More recent contributions come from figures such as Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, and Yann LeCun, whose work in deep learning has significantly advanced the capabilities of Narrow AI systems.
