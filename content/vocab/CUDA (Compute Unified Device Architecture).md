CUDA is significant for its ability to dramatically increase computing performance by harnessing the power of GPUs for non-graphical computing tasks. This technology is crucial in the field of AI, particularly for training deep neural networks, where the parallel processing capabilities of GPUs can be leveraged to handle the vast amounts of data and complex calculations required more efficiently than traditional CPUs. CUDA enables developers to direct C, C++, and Fortran code to be executed on the GPU, significantly accelerating computational tasks related to machine learning, scientific simulations, and graphics. Its widespread adoption in AI research and applications is due to the significant speedup it provides in the execution of parallel algorithms, a cornerstone in the training and inference phases of deep learning models.

Historical overview: CUDA was introduced by NVIDIA in 2007 as a means to program GPUs for tasks other than graphics, marking a pivotal shift towards general-purpose GPU computing (GPGPU). This technology democratized access to high-performance computing, enabling significant advancements in various fields, including AI, where it has become synonymous with deep learning due to the computational intensity of neural network training.

Key contributors: The development and popularization of CUDA are primarily attributed to NVIDIA, a company that has been at the forefront of GPU technology. NVIDIA's continuous innovation in both hardware and software has made CUDA the de facto standard for GPU-accelerated computing in AI and many other fields requiring high-performance computation.
