The Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA) addresses a growing concern in the digital age: the ease with which digital content can be manipulated and disseminated without clear origins, contributing to misinformation and eroding trust in digital media. By developing technical standards and specifications, C2PA aims to enable content creators, publishers, and distributors to provide end-users with metadata that certifies the source of content and details of any modifications made. This initiative is significant as it supports efforts to authenticate content across images, videos, documents, and more, thereby enhancing trust and transparency online. The C2PA's work is crucial in the context of AI and machine learning technologies, which are increasingly used to generate sophisticated deepfakes and other forms of synthetic media.

The concept of content provenance and the need for authenticity in digital media has been discussed for several years, but the formal coalition, C2PA, was announced in 2021. This initiative represents a collaborative effort among major tech companies and media organizations to standardize and implement technologies for verifying the authenticity and origin of digital content.

C2PA was formed by a group of leading tech companies and media stakeholders, including Adobe, Arm, BBC, Intel, Microsoft, and Truepic. These organizations have collectively contributed to the development and promotion of standards for digital content provenance and authenticity, aiming to address challenges related to misinformation and digital media manipulation.
