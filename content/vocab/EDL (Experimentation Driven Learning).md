title: EDL (Experimentation Driven Learning)
summary: AI approach where learning algorithms improve their performance through systematic experimentation and feedback from the environment.
---
In Experimentation Driven Learning, an AI agent actively engages in experiments within its environment to gather data and refine its models. This approach emphasizes the importance of trial and error, allowing the agent to explore various actions and observe the outcomes, thus learning from direct interaction rather than relying solely on pre-existing datasets. EDL is particularly valuable in dynamic and complex environments where the agent must adapt to new situations and unknown scenarios. It combines elements of reinforcement learning and active learning, where the agent iteratively tests hypotheses, updates its knowledge base, and optimizes its strategies based on the feedback received. This method enhances the agent's ability to generalize from specific instances, making it more robust and capable of handling real-world unpredictability.

Historical Overview: The concept of learning through experimentation has roots in early AI research, but it gained more explicit recognition with the advent of reinforcement learning in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The term "Experimentation Driven Learning" itself became more prominent in the early 2000s as AI research increasingly focused on adaptive systems capable of self-improvement through interaction with their environments.

Key Contributors: Key contributors to the development of EDL include Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto, whose work in reinforcement learning laid the foundational principles for experimentation-based approaches. Additionally, researchers like Sebastian Thrun and Peter Dayan have significantly advanced the field through their contributions to exploration strategies and the integration of learning mechanisms that leverage experimental data.
