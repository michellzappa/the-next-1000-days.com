title: Singularity
summary: Hypothetical future point at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable changes to human civilization.
---
In the context of artificial intelligence, the singularity refers to a future scenario where AI systems surpass human intelligence in all domains, leading to a runaway effect of technological growth. This concept often includes the notion that AI could improve itself recursively or could be used to create even more intelligent entities, potentially leading to exponential growth in intelligence that humans cannot predict or control. The implications of such an event are debated among experts, ranging from transformative advances in science and technology to existential risks for humanity.
Historical overview:

The term "singularity" in the context of technological advancement was popularized by Vernor Vinge, who in a 1993 essay predicted that such an event would occur within 30 years. The idea was further brought into mainstream discussions by futurist Ray Kurzweil, especially with his 2005 book "The Singularity Is Near," where he forecasted that the singularity might occur around 2045.
Key contributors:

Key figures in the development and discussion of the singularity concept include mathematician John von Neumann, who is credited with first using the term in the context of technological acceleration; science fiction writer Vernor Vinge, who articulated the implications for AI; and inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil, who extensively analyzed potential timelines and impacts of the singularity.
