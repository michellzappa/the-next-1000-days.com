title: Three Laws of Robotics

summary: Set of ethical guidelines designed to govern the behavior of robots and ensure their safe interaction with humans, proposed by science fiction writer Isaac Asimov.

---

**Detailed Explanation:**

The Three Laws of Robotics, introduced by Isaac Asimov in his 1942 short story "Runaround," are foundational principles intended to guide the development and behavior of intelligent robots. These laws are:

1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.

2. A robot must obey the orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.

3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws.

These laws are designed to ensure that robots operate safely and ethically within human environments, preventing harm to humans and ensuring robots act in a predictable manner. While originally a fictional construct, these principles have influenced real-world discussions about AI ethics and safety, serving as a conceptual framework for developing autonomous systems that prioritize human well-being.

  

**Historical Overview:**

The Three Laws of Robotics were first introduced in 1942 in Asimov's short story "Runaround," which is part of his "I, Robot" collection. The concept gained significant popularity with the publication of "I, Robot" in 1950, and has since become a seminal element in the discourse surrounding artificial intelligence and robotics ethics.

  

**Key Contributors:**

Isaac Asimov, a prolific science fiction writer, is the sole originator of the Three Laws of Robotics. His extensive body of work, including numerous novels and short stories, has profoundly influenced both science fiction and real-world perspectives on AI and robotics.
