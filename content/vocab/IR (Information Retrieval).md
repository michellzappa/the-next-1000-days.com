title: "IR (Information Retrieval)"
summary: "Process of obtaining relevant information from a large repository based on user queries."

Information Retrieval is a foundational aspect of NLP that focuses on the extraction of relevant data from large datasets or document collections in response to specific queries. This process involves indexing, searching, and ranking documents or data to find matches that satisfy user needs. The significance of IR extends across search engines, digital libraries, and information systems, where the ability to accurately retrieve information is crucial. Techniques such as vector space models, Boolean search, and more recently, deep learning approaches have significantly improved the efficiency and accuracy of IR systems.

Historical Overview: The field of Information Retrieval began to take shape in the 1950s, with notable growth in the 1970s as computing power increased and digital document collections became more common. The development of the Internet and the World Wide Web in the 1990s dramatically increased the importance and complexity of IR, leading to advanced algorithms and the development of major search engines.

Key Contributors: Gerard Salton, known as the father of Information Retrieval, made significant contributions to the field, including the development of the vector space model and the term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) weighting scheme, which have been foundational to the evolution of IR systems.
