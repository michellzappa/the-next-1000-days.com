title: Seq2Seq (Sequence to Sequence)
summary: Neural network architecture designed to transform sequences of data, such as converting a sentence from one language to another or translating speech into text.

**Detailed Explanation**: The Seq2Seq model is foundational in tasks requiring input and output data to be in sequential order but potentially differing in length. It typically comprises two key components: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder processes the input sequence and compresses it into a fixed-size context vector, capturing the essence of the sequence. This context vector is then fed into the decoder, which generates the output sequence. Crucially, Seq2Seq models have been the backbone of machine translation, conversational agents, and text summarization. The introduction of attention mechanisms, like those found in Transformer models, has further enhanced Seq2Seq by allowing the model to focus on specific parts of the input sequence when generating each part of the output.

**Historical Overview**: The concept of Seq2Seq was introduced in 2014, when deep learning researchers from Google, led by Ilya Sutskever, Oriol Vinyals, and Quoc V. Le, published a seminal paper on the topic. This work demonstrated the power of using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in a Seq2Seq framework, significantly advancing the field of natural language processing.

**Key Contributors**: The development of Seq2Seq models is primarily credited to Ilya Sutskever, Oriol Vinyals, and Quoc V. Le, who were instrumental in its formulation and popularization through their work at Google in 2014. Their research laid the groundwork for many modern AI applications involving sequence data.
