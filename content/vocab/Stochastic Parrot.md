title: "Stochastic Parrot"
summary: "Language models that generate text based on probabilistic predictions, often criticized for parroting information without understanding."
---
The term "stochastic parrot" describes large language models (LLMs) that utilize statistical methods to generate text that mimics human language. This metaphor highlights concerns about these models' ability to replicate human-like text outputs without genuine comprehension or awareness. Critics of LLMs often use this term to discuss the ethical implications of deploying AI systems that can produce coherent and persuasive text based on patterns learned from vast datasets, raising questions about misinformation, bias propagation, and the erosion of trust in digital communications. The debate around stochastic parrots touches on the broader issues of AI governance, the societal impact of AI technologies, and the challenges of creating models that are both useful and ethically sound.

Historical overview:
The term gained prominence in the AI community and public discourse around the time when large-scale language models began achieving remarkable levels of fluency and coherence, particularly with the publication of models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) starting from 2018. Discussions about the implications of these models for society, ethics, and the future of information integrity have only grown since.

Key contributors:
The concept and critique embodied by "stochastic parrot" have been discussed by various scholars and ethicists in AI, including Emily Bender and Timnit Gebru, among others. Their work, especially in the context of highlighting the ethical considerations and potential harms of deploying large language models, has been influential in shaping the discourse around the responsible development and use of AI technologies.
