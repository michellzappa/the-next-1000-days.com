title: Fast Takeoff
summary: Rapid transition from human-level to superintelligent AI, occurring in a very short period of time.
---
In the context of artificial intelligence, "fast takeoff" describes a scenario where an AI system rapidly advances from a state of being roughly as intelligent as a human to one that vastly exceeds human intelligence. This acceleration could happen in a matter of days, weeks, or even hours, leading to significant and potentially uncontrollable changes in technology, society, and the balance of power. The idea stems from the notion that once an AI reaches a level where it can improve its own algorithms and hardware autonomously, the improvements would compound at an exponential rate, creating a feedback loop of accelerating intelligence. This concept is crucial in discussions about AI safety and ethics, as a fast takeoff could pose substantial risks if not properly managed.

Historical Overview: The term "fast takeoff" began to gain traction in the early 2000s, with significant discussion occurring within the AI safety community. The idea was notably explored by philosopher Nick Bostrom in his 2014 book Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies, which brought widespread attention to the potential rapid escalation of AI capabilities.

Key Contributors: Key figures in the development and popularization of the "fast takeoff" concept include philosopher Nick Bostrom, AI researcher Eliezer Yudkowsky, and organizations like the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI). Their work has been instrumental in framing the discourse around the potential risks and ethical considerations of rapidly advancing AI technologies.
