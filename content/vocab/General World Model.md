General World Models are an advancement in machine learning where a system builds a versatile, comprehensive model of its environment. These models are designed to understand and simulate any aspect of the world they are trained on, thus allowing for high adaptability and forecasting ability in complex, dynamic situations. Unlike specialized models that are fine-tuned for specific tasks, General World Models aim to capture a wide array of environmental dynamics, making them applicable in multiple domains without retraining. This capability is rooted in the system's ability to abstract general principles from data, which can be applied to unseen conditions, thereby enhancing the AI's decision-making and problem-solving capacities.

Historical Overview: The concept of world models in AI was discussed as early as the 1970s but the term "General World Models" gained more specific attention in the 2010s with advancements in deep learning and reinforcement learning. The idea became particularly prominent after the introduction of more comprehensive and scalable neural network architectures that could integrate vast amounts of data across various modalities.

Key Contributors: While the development of General World Models is a collaborative effort involving many researchers and institutions, significant contributions have come from fields like reinforcement learning, cognitive computing, and systems neuroscience. Organizations like DeepMind and OpenAI have been at the forefront, pushing the boundaries of how machines can model and interpret complex environments.
