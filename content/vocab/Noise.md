title: "Noise"
summary: "Irrelevant or meaningless data in a dataset or unwanted variations in signals that can interfere with the training and performance of AI models."

Noise is a critical concept in AI, particularly in the fields of machine learning and neural networks, because it can significantly impact the accuracy and efficiency of AI systems. In datasets, noise can manifest as errors, irrelevant information, or anomalies that do not represent the underlying pattern or signal the AI is meant to learn. This can lead to models that are less accurate, overfit (too closely adapted to the training data, including its noise, and unable to generalize well), or underfit (unable to capture the underlying pattern of the data). In neural networks, noise can also be introduced intentionally during training (as in noise injection or data augmentation techniques) to improve the robustness and generalization of the model by preventing it from overfitting to the training data.

Historical overview: The concept of noise has been integral to signal processing and information theory since their inception, with formal definitions dating back to the early 20th century. Its significance in machine learning and AI became pronounced with the advent of more complex models and larger datasets in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

Key contributors: While it's challenging to attribute the concept of noise to specific individuals due to its broad application across multiple fields, Claude Shannon's work in information theory (notably his 1948 paper "A Mathematical Theory of Communication") significantly influenced the understanding of noise in the context of information transmission and processing. In the realm of AI and machine learning, many researchers have contributed to methodologies for handling noise in data and model training, making it a collective effort of the field.
