title: "Socratic Model"
summary: "Conversational AI that is designed to engage in dialogue in a manner akin to Socratic questioning, aiming to stimulate critical thinking and draw out ideas and underlying presuppositions."
---
In AI, the Socratic model embodies principles of the Socratic methodâ€”a form of cooperative argumentative dialogue between individuals, based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking and to draw out ideas and underlying presuppositions. This AI model focuses on fostering a deeper understanding and exploration of complex topics by challenging assumptions, probing the reasons behind beliefs, and exploring the consequences of these beliefs. Such models are crucial in educational technologies, where they can simulate tutor-like interactions, or in decision-support systems, where thorough analysis of scenarios is required.

Historical Overview: The concept of a Socratic model in AI draws directly from the Socratic method, an approach to teaching and discussion characterized by question-and-answer dialogue advocated by the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates around 400 BCE. The application of this method to AI systems began gaining attention with the advent of natural language processing and machine learning advancements in the late 20th century, particularly as developers aimed to create more interactive and engaging AI systems.

Key Contributors: While specific key contributors to the Socratic model in AI are not typically highlighted as prominently as in other fields, the development of this model relies heavily on the broader contributions of researchers in natural language processing, educational technology, and cognitive science. These contributors focus on integrating principles of human dialogue, teaching, and psychology into the design of conversational agents.
