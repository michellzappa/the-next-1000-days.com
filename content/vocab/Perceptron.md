The perceptron algorithm, introduced by Frank Rosenblatt in 1957, is foundational for understanding neural networks. It is a type of linear classifier, meaning it makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector. The concept relies on adjusting these weights based on the input features to predict whether the input belongs to one class or another. If the output is above a certain threshold, the perceptron predicts one class; otherwise, it predicts another. This mechanism closely mimics the biological processes of neurons in the human brain, which fire (activate) or don't fire based on the strength of incoming signals. Despite its simplicity, the perceptron laid the groundwork for more complex neural networks by demonstrating how machines could learn from data and make decisions.

The perceptron was developed in 1957 by Frank Rosenblatt, marking one of the earliest attempts to simulate the decision-making process of human neurons with a machine. Its development played a crucial role in the early days of artificial intelligence and contributed to the establishment of the field of neural networks. However, its inability to solve non-linearly separable problems (e.g., the XOR problem) led to a decline in interest until the resurgence of neural networks in the 1980s with the introduction of multi-layer perceptrons and backpropagation.

Frank Rosenblatt is the key figure behind the development of the perceptron. His work at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory was instrumental in laying the foundation for the field of neural networks and deep learning.
