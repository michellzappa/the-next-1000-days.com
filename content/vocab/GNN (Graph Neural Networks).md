title: GNN (Graph Neural Networks)
summary: Type of neural network designed for processing data represented in graph form, capturing relationships and structure within the data.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) represent a significant advancement in the field of deep learning, designed specifically to handle graph-structured data. Unlike traditional neural networks that assume the data is in Euclidean space (like images, text, or tabular data), GNNs work with data that is in non-Euclidean, graph form, where entities (nodes) are connected by relationships (edges). This makes GNNs particularly well-suited for applications like social network analysis, recommendation systems, drug discovery, and fraud detection, where data is inherently relational. GNNs operate by learning to aggregate information from a node's neighbors, effectively capturing both local structures (like node connectivity) and global structures (overall graph topology) in the data. This ability to model relationships directly in the data opens new avenues for AI applications that rely on complex, interconnected data.

The concept of GNNs was introduced in the early 2000s, with significant advancements and popularization occurring in the late 2010s. Early formulations were challenging to scale and lacked the theoretical frameworks that current versions possess.

Thomas N. Kipf and Max Welling made significant contributions to the development and popularization of GNNs with their work on Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), a specific type of GNN, introduced in 2016. Their work simplified the design of GNNs and demonstrated the potential for wide application, helping to catalyze research and development in this area.
