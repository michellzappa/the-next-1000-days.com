Detailed Explanation: In AI, benchmarks are crucial for evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of different algorithms and models. These benchmarks typically consist of datasets, tasks, or problem sets that are widely accepted within the community. By providing a common ground for comparison, benchmarks help researchers and practitioners assess progress, identify strengths and weaknesses of various approaches, and facilitate replicability of experiments. They are integral to advancing the field, ensuring that innovations are rigorously tested and compared against established standards.

Historical Overview: The concept of benchmarking in computer science dates back to the 1970s, with its application in AI becoming prominent in the 1980s and 1990s. The popularity of benchmarks surged with the rise of machine learning competitions and the release of large, publicly available datasets in the 2000s and 2010s.

Key Contributors: Notable contributors to the development and use of benchmarks in AI include organizations and groups such as the University of California, Irvine (UCI) with their Machine Learning Repository, Kaggle for its competitive data science platform, and the ImageNet project led by Fei-Fei Li, which revolutionized computer vision benchmarks.
