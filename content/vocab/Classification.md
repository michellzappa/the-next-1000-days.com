Classification involves using labeled datasets to train algorithms that can then categorize new, unseen data. These algorithms learn patterns and relationships within the data, allowing them to predict the class labels for new instances. Common applications include spam detection, image recognition, and medical diagnosis. Techniques used in classification range from simple methods like logistic regression to more complex approaches such as support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees, and neural networks.

Historically, the concept of classification has been integral to the development of statistics and machine learning, with key advancements emerging in the mid-20th century. The term gained prominence in AI with the rise of machine learning in the 1980s and 1990s as computational power increased, enabling more sophisticated models.

Pioneers in the field of classification include Ronald A. Fisher, who introduced linear discriminant analysis in 1936, and more recent contributors like Vladimir Vapnik, who co-developed the SVM algorithm in the 1990s. Their work laid the foundation for modern classification techniques and applications.
