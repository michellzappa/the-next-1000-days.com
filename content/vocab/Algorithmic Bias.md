title: Algorithmic Bias
summary: Systematic and unfair discrimination embedded in the outcomes of algorithms, often reflecting prejudices present in the training data or design process.
---
Algorithmic bias manifests when machine learning models or other algorithmic systems produce results that are prejudiced due to biased training data, flawed design, or the interaction of these systems with social inequalities. This bias can lead to unfair treatment of individuals or groups based on race, gender, age, or other characteristics. The significance of addressing algorithmic bias lies in its potential to perpetuate and even exacerbate existing social inequalities, particularly in high-stakes domains such as criminal justice, hiring, and healthcare. Researchers and practitioners are actively working to develop methods to detect, mitigate, and eliminate such biases to ensure fairer and more ethical AI systems.

Historical Overview: The term "algorithmic bias" began to gain prominence in the early 2010s as the widespread deployment of machine learning and AI systems highlighted various instances of biased outcomes. Concerns over algorithmic fairness became more pronounced with notable cases, such as biased hiring algorithms and facial recognition systems demonstrating racial and gender bias.

Key Contributors: Significant contributions to the understanding and mitigation of algorithmic bias have come from researchers such as Joy Buolamwini, who highlighted racial bias in facial recognition technologies, and Timnit Gebru, who has extensively studied the ethical implications of AI. Organizations like the AI Now Institute and fairness-focused initiatives within tech companies have also played crucial roles in advancing this field.
