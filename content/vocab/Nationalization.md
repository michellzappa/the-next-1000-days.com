Nationalization in AI occurs when a government takes ownership or control of AI systems, data, or companies that are deemed vital to national security, economic stability, or public welfare. This can involve the acquisition of private AI firms, regulation of AI research and development, or the imposition of strict controls on data usage and AI deployment. The rationale behind such actions often centers on preventing foreign influence, ensuring ethical use, and protecting critical infrastructure from external threats. Nationalization can also be a response to the rapid pace of AI advancements, where governments may feel the need to directly manage AI's societal impacts, including issues like job displacement, privacy concerns, and inequality.

Historical Overview: The concept of nationalization has been prominent in economic policy for centuries, but its application to AI began gaining attention in the late 2010s and early 2020s. This was driven by the increasing strategic importance of AI and concerns over foreign dominance in AI technology, especially amid rising geopolitical tensions.

Key Contributors: The discourse around AI nationalization has been shaped by government bodies, think tanks, and experts in technology policy. Notable contributors include government agencies like the U.S. Department of Defense and the European Commission, which have explored or implemented strategies to secure AI assets. Academics and policy experts, such as those at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the Center for Security and Emerging Technology, have also been influential in framing the debate on AI nationalization.
