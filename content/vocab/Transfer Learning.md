title: "Transfer Learning"
summary: "ML method where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task, leveraging the knowledge gained from the first task to improve performance on the second."

Transfer learning is a powerful technique in machine learning that addresses the problem of having a limited amount of data for training models on a new task. It involves taking a pre-trained model (a model trained on a large dataset for a task that is related, but not identical, to the target task) and repurposing it for a different but related problem. By reusing the weights and architecture of the pre-trained model, transfer learning allows for significant improvements in learning efficiency and prediction accuracy for the new task, especially when the new task has relatively little data available for training. This is particularly useful in deep learning, where large models can be fine-tuned for specific tasks with comparatively less computational cost and time.

Historical overview: The concept of transfer learning has roots in psychology and has been part of the machine learning vocabulary since at least the late 1990s. Its popularity surged in the 2010s with the rise of deep learning, as researchers and practitioners found that models pre-trained on large datasets like ImageNet could be adapted to a wide range of tasks with relatively little additional training.

Key contributors: While it is challenging to credit the development of transfer learning to specific individuals due to its broad and interdisciplinary nature, significant early work in machine learning and neural networks by Geoffrey Hinton, Yann LeCun, and Yoshua Bengio laid the foundational theories and technologies that enable today's applications of transfer learning. Additionally, the creation and distribution of large-scale datasets and deep learning frameworks have greatly facilitated the widespread adoption and innovation of transfer learning techniques within the AI community.
