title: "Find+Replace Transformers"
summary: "Novel architectural extension of traditional transformers, designed to achieve Turing completeness and enhance model performance on complex tasks."
---
Find+Replace Transformers represent an advancement in transformer technology, addressing the limitation of traditional transformers which are not Turing complete. This architecture integrates multiple transformers in a manner that allows for the execution of more complex, programmable operations that a single transformer cannot perform. The key feature is its ability to emulate arbitrary computational functionalities by decomposing them into simpler transformer-executable tasks. This capability is essential for tasks requiring higher-order reasoning and generalization beyond fixed pattern recognition, making them particularly valuable for tasks that benefit from deep semantic understanding and flexible adaptation.

Historical Overview: The concept was introduced in a paper submitted to ICLR in 2024, emerging as a response to the growing need for more dynamic and programmable neural architectures in machine learning, specifically within the realm of deep learning and NLP.

Key Contributors: The development of Find+Replace Transformers was led by Shriyash Kaustubh Upadhyay and Etan Jacob Ginsberg, who presented the initial concept and theoretical underpinnings in their academic submission, highlighting its potential to surpass existing models like GPT-4 in specific computational tasks.
