Steerability is a concept of significant interest in the study and application of neural networks, highlighting the flexibility and controllability of these models in generating desired outcomes. It is particularly relevant in tasks where fine-grained control over the outputs is necessary, such as in image generation and style transfer, where adjusting certain attributes or aspects of the generated images without altering others is desired. This concept is also pertinent in understanding how changes in the network's inputs or parameters can systematically alter its behavior, offering insights into the network's internal representations and functioning. Steerability extends the utility of neural networks by enabling more dynamic and targeted applications, enhancing their adaptability to specific tasks or requirements.

The notion of steerability in neural networks gained prominence with the advent of deep learning, particularly as researchers began exploring more sophisticated manipulation and control mechanisms over neural network outputs in the 2010s. The ability to "steer" the output of a network has implications for interpretability, allowing researchers to better understand the relationship between input variations and output changes.

Key contributors to the development of steerability in neural networks include researchers focused on interpretability and control mechanisms within deep learning models. While specific names are not mentioned in the provided knowledge, this area of research is interdisciplinary, involving contributions from computer science, applied mathematics, and cognitive science disciplines.
