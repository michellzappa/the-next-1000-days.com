title: Adversarial Attacks
summary: Manipulating input data to deceive machine learning models, causing them to make incorrect predictions or classifications.
---
Detailed Explanation
Adversarial attacks exploit the vulnerabilities in machine learning models by introducing subtle, often imperceptible changes to input data that lead the model to make errors. These attacks can take various forms, including adding noise to images, altering text, or modifying input sequences in ways that are not easily noticeable by humans but cause significant misclassification or malfunction in the AI system. The primary goal of adversarial attacks is to expose weaknesses in models, which is crucial for improving the robustness and security of AI systems. These attacks are particularly concerning in high-stakes applications like autonomous driving, healthcare, and security, where incorrect decisions can have severe consequences.

Historical Overview
The concept of adversarial attacks emerged in the early 2000s, but it gained significant traction around 2014 with the work of researchers like Christian Szegedy and Ian Goodfellow, who demonstrated how deep neural networks could be easily fooled by carefully crafted perturbations. Since then, the field has rapidly evolved, with increasing attention on both attack strategies and defensive mechanisms.

Key Contributors
Key figures in the development of adversarial attacks include Christian Szegedy, who published pioneering work on adversarial examples, and Ian Goodfellow, who introduced the concept of the "fast gradient sign method" (FGSM) for generating adversarial examples. Their contributions have been fundamental in shaping the understanding and further research into the vulnerabilities of machine learning models.
