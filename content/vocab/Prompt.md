title: "Prompt"
summary: "User-generated input or question designed to elicit a specific response or output from the model."

A prompt serves as the initial interaction point between a user and a Large Language Model (LLM), guiding the AI's response generation process based on the input's context, structure, and content. This interaction paradigm is central to how LLMs, like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) models, operate, leveraging vast amounts of pre-existing text data to produce responses that are relevant, coherent, and sometimes creative. The effectiveness of a prompt can significantly influence the quality and relevance of the AI's output, making prompt engineering a critical skill in AI development and application. This entails crafting prompts that effectively communicate the user's intent to the AI, optimizing for clarity, specificity, and alignment with the model's training data.

The concept of prompts gained prominence with the advent of transformer-based models around 2017, especially as these models' capabilities for natural language understanding and generation became increasingly sophisticated. The practice of prompt engineering evolved as a pivotal technique for interacting with and extracting desired outputs from AI models without the need for further training or fine-tuning.

While no single individual or group can be credited with the invention of the AI prompt concept, researchers at OpenAI, Google Brain, and other institutions have played significant roles in the development and refinement of Large Language Models, thus indirectly contributing to the prominence and understanding of prompts in AI interactions.
