title: "GFlowNet (Generative Flow Networks)"
summary: "Research direction at the intersection of reinforcement learning, deep generative models, and energy-based probabilistic modeling, aimed at improving generative active learning and unsupervised learning."
---
GFlowNets represent a novel approach in artificial intelligence, residing at the confluence of several AI subfields including reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and probabilistic inference. This framework is designed to address complex probabilistic modeling tasks by efficiently sampling from distributions over complicated data structures, such as graphs representing molecules or causal relationships. GFlowNets facilitate the learning of these distributions in a manner that was previously considered challenging, opening up new possibilities for AI applications in fields such as drug discovery, active learning, and the exploration of generative spaces. The significance of GFlowNets lies in their potential to enable more sophisticated and nuanced models of the world, enhancing AI's ability to understand and interact with its environment in a meaningful way.

Historical Overview: The concept of GFlowNets was introduced by Yoshua Bengio and his team around 2021. It represents a significant leap in generative modeling research, highlighting the ongoing efforts to integrate insights from various domains of AI to solve complex problems.

Key Contributors: Yoshua Bengio, a leading figure in the field of deep learning and AI, has been instrumental in the development and promotion of GFlowNets. His work, alongside contributions from his students and collaborators, has established the foundation for GFlowNets as a promising area of AI research ​[](https://yoshuabengio.org/2022/03/05/generative-flow-networks/)​.
