title: Panel-of-Experts
summary: Decision-making system where multiple experts provide their opinions or solutions, and the consensus or most supported option is chosen.

Detailed Explanation: In AI, a Panel-of-Experts system leverages the collective intelligence of several specialized models or human experts to improve decision-making and problem-solving. Each expert, often with a distinct area of focus or methodology, provides input on a given problem. These inputs are then aggregated, using methods such as voting schemes, averaging, or weighted decision rules, to arrive at a final decision. This approach aims to mitigate individual biases, increase accuracy, and leverage diverse perspectives. It is particularly useful in complex scenarios where a single model might be insufficient, such as in medical diagnostics, financial forecasting, or autonomous systems. The diversity and independence of the experts are critical to the effectiveness of this system.

Historical Overview: The concept of using multiple experts dates back to early 20th-century practices in various fields but was formally introduced in AI and machine learning contexts around the 1990s. The term gained prominence with the development of ensemble methods in machine learning, such as bagging and boosting, which aggregate predictions from multiple models.

Key Contributors: Significant contributors to the development of the Panel-of-Experts approach include Leo Breiman, who introduced the concept of bagging in 1996, and Robert Schapire and Yoav Freund, who developed boosting algorithms in the late 1990s. These methods laid the groundwork for modern ensemble techniques, embodying the principles of the Panel-of-Experts system.
