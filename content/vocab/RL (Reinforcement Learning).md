title: "RL (Reinforcement Learning)"
summary: "Type of ML where an agent learns to make decisions by performing actions in an environment to achieve a goal, guided by rewards."

Reinforcement Learning is a crucial branch of machine learning that focuses on training models to make a sequence of decisions. It operates on the principle of agents interacting with an environment to achieve certain objectives, with their actions guided by rewards or punishments. Unlike supervised learning, where models learn from a dataset containing input-output pairs, RL agents learn from trial and error, continuously improving their strategy to maximize cumulative rewards over time. This approach enables RL to solve complex problems where explicit programming or direct teaching is infeasible, including dynamic decision-making and adaptive control systems. Key concepts in RL include the state, which represents the current situation of the environment; the action, which is any decision the agent makes; the reward, a feedback from the environment to assess the value of an action; and the policy, which is a strategy that the agent follows to decide actions based on states.

The concept of Reinforcement Learning has roots in the fields of psychology, neuroscience, and computer science, evolving significantly since its initial discussions in the 1950s. However, it gained substantial momentum in the 1980s with the development of formal algorithms and models. The introduction of the Q-learning algorithm in 1989 and the development of deep reinforcement learning techniques in the 2010s, exemplified by DeepMind's AlphaGo, have marked significant milestones in RL's evolution.

While many researchers have contributed to the field, Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto are among the most significant figures in the development of reinforcement learning. Their work, especially the publication of "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction" in 1998, has been foundational, providing a comprehensive overview of the theory and practice of RL.
