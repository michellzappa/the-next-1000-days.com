title: "RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)"
summary: "Technique that combines reinforcement learning (RL) with human feedback to guide the learning process towards desired outcomes."

Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) extends traditional reinforcement learning by incorporating feedback from humans as part of the reward signal or as guidance in the learning process. This approach is particularly valuable in scenarios where defining an explicit reward function is challenging or where human intuition and preferences play a crucial role in shaping the desired behavior. By integrating human feedback, RLHF aims to align the AI's actions more closely with human values, ethics, and preferences, enhancing the applicability and acceptability of AI systems in real-world applications. This methodology has been instrumental in training models for complex decision-making tasks, where the subtleties of human judgment are difficult to encapsulate purely through algorithmic means.

Historical Overview: The concept of integrating human feedback into machine learning processes has been discussed since the early days of AI, but the formalization and widespread application of RLHF have gained significant traction in the past decade. Techniques such as preference-based reinforcement learning and inverse reinforcement learning have laid the groundwork for RLHF, evolving with advancements in deep learning and the increased capability to process complex data and environments.

Key Contributors: While no single individual or group can be credited with the invention of RLHF, the development has been driven by the broader research community working on reinforcement learning, human-computer interaction, and ethical AI. Organizations like DeepMind, OpenAI, and various academic institutions have made notable contributions to advancing RLHF methodologies and applications.
