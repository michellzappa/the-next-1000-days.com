The concept of a Human Point of Contact (HPOC) is crucial in environments where AI systems interface directly with human users or other automated systems, requiring oversight to ensure effective communication and problem resolution. The role of an HPOC is to facilitate smooth operations, address any issues that arise during AI-human interactions, and maintain the system's integrity by providing a human oversight capability. This role is particularly important in complex systems where AI decisions need to be interpreted or explained to non-expert users, or in regulated industries where compliance and accountability are critical.

The term HPOC has been used in various technological and customer service contexts for many years, although its specific adoption in AI-related applications has become more prominent with the increased deployment of complex AI systems, especially those involved in critical and interactive roles, since the early 2000s.

There are no specific individuals or groups uniquely credited with developing the concept of an HPOC as it is a role that has evolved naturally with the expansion of technology in customer and technical support sectors. However, organizations implementing robust AI systems, particularly in customer-facing and regulatory environments, have played a significant role in defining the responsibilities and significance of the HPOC role.
