title: "Symbolic AI"
summary: "Also known as "Good Old-Fashioned AI" (GOFAI), involves the manipulation of symbols to represent problems and compute solutions through rules."

Symbolic AI represents a foundational approach in artificial intelligence where abstract symbols are used to represent various elements and constructs of the problem space. These symbols are then manipulated through logic and rules to simulate intelligent behavior. This method emphasizes the use of human-readable representations that can be directly understood and manipulated according to logical rules. It was particularly dominant in the early years of AI research and development, focusing on areas such as expert systems, natural language processing, and theorem proving, where knowledge could be encoded in a structured, rule-based format. The approach relies on the premise that all human thought can be represented by symbols and rules for manipulating these symbols, drawing heavily from the fields of logic and philosophy.

Symbolic AI was at the forefront of AI research from the 1950s to the late 1980s. It gained popularity for its success in developing systems that could solve complex problems in well-defined domains. Notable projects like SHRDLU, an early natural language understanding program, and MYCIN, an expert system for identifying bacteria and recommending antibiotics, exemplified the potential of Symbolic AI in the 1970s.

Key contributors to the development and evolution of Symbolic AI include researchers like Allen Newell and Herbert A. Simon, who were pioneers in the field. They developed the General Problem Solver (GPS) in the late 1950s, an early attempt to model human problem-solving techniques with computers. Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy were also significant figures, contributing foundational ideas and advocating for the potential of artificial intelligence grounded in symbolic reasoning.
