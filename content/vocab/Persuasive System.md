---
Persuasive systems are designed to influence users' attitudes or behaviors in a predetermined direction without using coercion or deception. These systems utilize principles from social psychology, communication theory, and human-computer interaction, embedding persuasive elements within the technology. Common techniques include customization of information, reminder messages, and social proof, among others. They are particularly prevalent in health, education, and marketing sectors, where they aim to promote beneficial behaviors such as increased physical activity or improved diet.

Historical overview: The concept of persuasive systems originated from the field of captology, a term coined by B.J. Fogg in the late 1990s. The formal study and development of persuasive systems began to gain traction in the early 2000s, as researchers and developers saw the potential for interactive technologies to influence human behavior.

Key contributors: B.J. Fogg, a psychologist and technology researcher at Stanford University, is a pioneer in this field. His work on the "Fogg Behavior Model" lays the foundational theory for understanding how technology can be designed to change behavior.
