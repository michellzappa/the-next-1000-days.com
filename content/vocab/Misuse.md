Misuse of AI encompasses a broad range of unethical practices, including privacy violations, spreading disinformation, and creating biased algorithms. These practices can lead to significant social, ethical, and legal issues. For instance, AI can be used to automate and scale activities like surveillance without adequate oversight, or to develop autonomous weapons systems that pose new challenges to international security. The potency of AI in analyzing vast amounts of data can also lead to discrimination if not properly managed, with systems potentially reinforcing existing biases found in training data.

The concept of AI misuse has been discussed since the early 2000s as AI applications began to proliferate in various sectors, raising concerns about their potential negative impacts. It gained more focused attention with the advent of more advanced machine learning techniques and their implications in the last decade.

Key contributors to the discussion and guidelines on AI misuse include ethical bodies, international organizations, and researchers focused on responsible AI development, such as the Future of Life Institute and the AI Now Institute. These groups emphasize creating frameworks and regulations to prevent harmful applications of AI technology.
