Expert-Level Explanation:
Motor learning in the context of AI and robotics involves developing algorithms and techniques that enable machines to improve their physical actions and coordination over time. This process is akin to how humans and animals learn motor skills through repetition and feedback. Techniques often employed in motor learning include reinforcement learning, supervised learning, and imitation learning. Reinforcement learning involves agents learning optimal actions through rewards and punishments. Supervised learning requires a dataset of correct actions for training, while imitation learning involves mimicking observed behaviors. The goal is to create adaptive systems that can handle complex tasks, such as walking, grasping, or playing sports, in dynamic and uncertain environments. Motor learning algorithms are crucial for advancements in autonomous robots, prosthetics, and human-robot interaction.

Historical Overview:
The concept of motor learning has roots in biological studies of how animals and humans learn new motor skills. In robotics and AI, significant attention began in the 1980s with the advent of machine learning techniques. The 1990s and early 2000s saw substantial progress with the development of reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly following the introduction of Q-learning in 1989. The popularity of deep learning in the 2010s further accelerated advancements in motor learning, allowing for more complex and efficient models.

Key Contributors:
Key contributors to the development of motor learning in AI and robotics include Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto, who pioneered reinforcement learning techniques, and Yann LeCun, Geoffrey Hinton, and Yoshua Bengio, who advanced deep learning methods that are critical for modern motor learning. In robotics, researchers like Oussama Khatib and Stefan Schaal have made significant contributions to the understanding and application of motor learning algorithms in robotic systems.
