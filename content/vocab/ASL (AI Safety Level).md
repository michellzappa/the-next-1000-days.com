title: "ASL (AI Safety Level)"
summary: "Tiered system for categorizing the risk levels associated with AI systems to guide their development and deployment responsibly."
---
ASL is a conceptual framework designed to assess and categorize the risk levels of AI systems, particularly those with advanced capabilities that might pose catastrophic risks. This classification system helps developers and stakeholders to implement appropriate safety measures and risk mitigations at different stages of AI development. The framework is typically part of broader safety and governance strategies like Preparedness Frameworks or Responsible Scaling Policies, which are designed to ensure that AI development aligns with ethical guidelines and minimizes potential negative impacts on society and individuals. By defining specific criteria and thresholds for different safety levels, ASL allows organizations to gauge when an AI system's capabilities might necessitate additional oversight, security measures, or even halting further development to prevent misuse or unintended consequences.

Historical overview: The concept of ASL, as a structured approach to AI safety, is relatively new and has been discussed more explicitly within the last few years as AI technologies have advanced. The need for such frameworks has become increasingly apparent with the deployment of more capable AI systems, which pose higher risks.

Key contributors: The development of ASL frameworks involves contributions from leading AI research organizations like OpenAI and Anthropic, which have been at the forefront of creating and implementing these safety standards. These organizations work in conjunction with academic institutions and safety experts to refine the criteria and thresholds that define different safety levels, aiming to establish industry-wide standards for responsible AI development.
