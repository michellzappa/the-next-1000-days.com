---
NPCs in video games and simulations are designed to interact with players or the environment in a way that mimics human or lifelike behavior, making the virtual world more engaging and realistic. The creation and behavior of NPCs often leverage AI techniques such as finite state machines, behavior trees, and more recently, machine learning models to simulate intelligence, decision-making, and social interactions. This application of AI allows NPCs to adapt to player actions, exhibit complex behaviors, and contribute to dynamic storytelling and immersive gameplay experiences.

Historical overview: The concept of NPCs dates back to the early days of video games in the 1970s, where simple programmed behaviors were used. The term gained popularity and complexity with the advancement of gaming technology, reaching a point where NPCs' behaviors are often indistinguishable from those of players in terms of complexity and unpredictability.

Key contributors: The development of NPC behavior is a collective effort spanning the video game industry, with contributions from programmers, game designers, and AI researchers. Companies like Square Enix, Rockstar Games, and Naughty Dog are known for their advanced use of AI in creating lifelike NPCs in their games.
