title: "Confidential Computing"
summary: "Security measure that protects data in use by performing computation in a hardware-based environment, preventing unauthorized access or visibility even if the system is compromised."

Confidential Computing addresses a critical challenge in data security and privacy by ensuring that data remains encrypted not only at rest and in transit but also when being processed. This capability is pivotal for sensitive applications, including those in AI, where proprietary or personal data requires processing without exposing it to cloud providers, system administrators, or potential attackers. It leverages hardware-based TEEs (Trusted Execution Environments), such as Intel SGX or AMD SEV, to create secure enclaves where data can be processed in isolation from the rest of the system. This approach significantly enhances the security posture of cloud computing environments and is fundamental in regulatory compliance, protecting intellectual property, and securing AI inference and training phases against emerging threats.

Historical overview: The concept of Confidential Computing has gained prominence in the last decade, with significant developments occurring in the mid-2010s as cloud computing adoption increased and the demand for enhanced data privacy and security solutions became evident.

Key contributors: While no single entity or individual can be credited with the inception of Confidential Computing, it is the product of collaborative efforts among major technology companies and the Confidential Computing Consortium, a project within the Linux Foundation that includes industry giants like Google, Intel, Microsoft, and AMD. These organizations have been instrumental in developing the standards, hardware, and software that make Confidential Computing possible.
