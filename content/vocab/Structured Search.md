title: "Structured Search"
summary: "Method of querying and retrieving information from databases and other structured data sources where data is organized in defined types and relationships."

Structured search is crucial in databases, information systems, and specific types of content management systems where data is pre-organized in a predictable format, such as tables with rows and columns. This organization allows for precise queries using languages like SQL (Structured Query Language), enabling users to extract exact information based on specific criteria. It contrasts with unstructured search, which deals with data not organized in a predefined manner, such as text or multimedia content. Structured search is foundational in fields that rely on large volumes of organized data, like financial services, healthcare, and e-commerce, where quick, accurate access to specific data points is critical for operations.

Historical Overview: The concept of structured search has been integral to database management systems since their inception, particularly with the development of relational databases in the 1970s. SQL, developed by IBM in the early 1970s, popularized structured querying, fundamentally shaping how data is retrieved in structured environments.

Key Contributors: Edgar F. Codd, an English computer scientist working for IBM, was pivotal in the development of relational database theories, which underpin structured search. His work laid the foundation for the SQL language and established the theoretical framework for relational databases, which organize data into tables and allow for structured querying.
