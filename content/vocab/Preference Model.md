title: Preference Model
summary: Computational framework used to predict and understand an individual's preferences, often applied in recommendation systems and decision-making processes.
---
Preference models are designed to quantify and represent individual preferences based on observed behavior, such as choices, ratings, or interactions. These models utilize various algorithms, including machine learning techniques like collaborative filtering, matrix factorization, and neural networks, to infer preferences from data. By capturing the latent factors that influence decisions, preference models help in personalizing recommendations, optimizing user experiences, and improving decision support systems. They are crucial in domains like e-commerce, streaming services, and targeted advertising, where understanding user preferences can significantly enhance engagement and satisfaction.

Historical Overview:
The concept of preference modeling emerged in the early 1990s, gaining significant traction in the mid-2000s with the advent of sophisticated recommendation systems, especially with the Netflix Prize competition in 2006-2009, which spurred advances in collaborative filtering techniques and recommender system algorithms.

Key Contributors:
Significant contributors to the development of preference models include Yehuda Koren, for his work on matrix factorization techniques in the context of the Netflix Prize, and researchers like John Riedl and Joseph A. Konstan, who made substantial contributions to collaborative filtering and recommender systems. Their work laid the groundwork for the sophisticated preference modeling techniques used today.
