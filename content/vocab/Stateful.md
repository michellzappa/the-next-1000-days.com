title: Stateful
summary: System or application that saves client data from previous sessions to influence and personalize future interactions.
---
In computing and software design, a stateful system maintains a record of previous interactions and changes its behavior based on that history. This concept is crucial in applications where user session data must be preserved for continuity, such as in web applications, where the server keeps track of users' login status, shopping carts, and browsing history. Statefulness allows for more complex, personalized user interactions, as the system can store and retrieve user preferences, past activities, and other contextual information. This approach contrasts with stateless systems, which treat each request as an entirely new interaction, independent of any previous activity.

Historical Overview:
The concept of statefulness in computing emerged with the development of interactive and transactional systems, particularly noticeable since the 1970s with the advent of session-based networking protocols and early web technologies. It became more prominently discussed as web applications and databases became more sophisticated in the late 1990s and early 2000s.

Key Contributors:
The development of stateful systems is closely tied to advancements in network protocols and database technology, with significant contributions from computer scientists and engineers involved in developing early networking protocols like TCP/IP and database management systems, which inherently supported stateful operations.
