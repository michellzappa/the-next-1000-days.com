title: On-the-fly Program Synthesis

summary: Automatic creation of executable code in real-time, typically during the execution of a program or in response to specific, immediate computational needs.

---

**Detailed Explanation:**

On-the-fly program synthesis involves dynamically generating programs or code snippets in response to particular runtime conditions or requirements. Unlike traditional program synthesis, which often occurs offline and requires significant computational resources, on-the-fly synthesis aims to create correct and efficient code instantaneously as part of a running system. This technique leverages formal methods, constraint solving, and domain-specific languages to ensure that the generated code adheres to the desired specifications and constraints. It is particularly useful in adaptive systems, real-time applications, and environments where pre-defined code cannot anticipate all possible scenarios, thus requiring real-time adaptability and customization.

  

**Historical Overview:**

The concept of on-the-fly program synthesis has roots in the early 2000s, with significant advancements in the late 2010s and early 2020s as formal methods and constraint-solving techniques matured. Its popularity increased alongside the development of more sophisticated AI and machine learning algorithms capable of real-time decision making and adaptation.

  

**Key Contributors:**

Key contributors to the development of on-the-fly program synthesis include researchers in the fields of formal methods and automated reasoning, such as Sumit Gulwani, who has made significant strides in program synthesis and automated programming. Institutions like Microsoft Research and academic groups at institutions such as MIT and Stanford have also been pivotal in advancing this field.
