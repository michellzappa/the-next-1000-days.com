title: Log-Likelihood
summary: Measure used in statistical models to quantify how well a model predicts a given set of observations, expressed as the logarithm of the likelihood function.

In statistical modeling and machine learning, the log-likelihood function is crucial for parameter estimation and model evaluation. It transforms the product of probabilities (which can be very small and numerically unstable) into a sum, making computations more tractable. Maximizing the log-likelihood helps find the parameter values that make the observed data most probable, which is a foundational method in Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). This concept is widely used in various fields, including econometrics, bioinformatics, and natural language processing, due to its robustness and efficiency in handling large datasets.

Historical Overview:
The concept of likelihood was introduced by Ronald A. Fisher in 1921, laying the groundwork for modern statistical inference. The use of log-likelihood emerged as a natural extension to simplify computations and has been integral to statistical practices since the mid-20th century, particularly gaining prominence with the advent of computational statistics and machine learning algorithms.

Key Contributors:
Ronald A. Fisher is the most significant figure associated with the development of likelihood theory. His pioneering work in the early 20th century established the foundation for modern statistical methods. Subsequent contributions by statisticians and mathematicians such as Jerzy Neyman and Egon Pearson further developed the theoretical underpinnings and practical applications of likelihood and log-likelihood in statistical inference.
