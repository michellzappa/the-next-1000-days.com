Detailed Explanation:
Compute efficiency is a critical metric in the field of computing and artificial intelligence, signifying how well a system utilizes its hardware and software resources to perform tasks. It encompasses the optimization of processing power, memory usage, and energy consumption to achieve the highest possible throughput and lowest latency. In AI, compute efficiency is vital for training models and running algorithms more quickly and cost-effectively. Efficient computation can lead to significant reductions in operational costs and environmental impact, making it a key consideration in the design and deployment of AI systems. Techniques to improve compute efficiency include algorithm optimization, parallel processing, and hardware acceleration through GPUs and TPUs.

Historical Overview:
The concept of compute efficiency has been present since the early days of computing, but it became especially prominent with the advent of personal computers in the 1980s and the exponential growth of data processing demands in the 2000s. The need for efficient computation has grown alongside advancements in AI and big data analytics, particularly with the increased use of deep learning models in the 2010s.

Key Contributors:
Significant contributions to compute efficiency have come from both hardware and software domains. Notable figures include Seymour Cray, known for his work in high-performance computing and supercomputers, and John Hennessy and David Patterson, who pioneered the RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing) architecture that improved processing efficiency. In recent years, researchers at companies like Google, NVIDIA, and Intel have also made substantial advancements in hardware acceleration technologies that enhance compute efficiency.
