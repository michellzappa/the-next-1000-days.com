title: Convolution
summary: Mathematical operation used in signal processing and image processing to combine two functions, resulting in a third function that represents how one function modifies the other.

Detailed Explanation:
In the context of AI and deep learning, convolution refers to the process of applying a convolutional filter (or kernel) to an input, such as an image, to produce an output feature map. This operation is fundamental in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), where it allows the network to detect and learn hierarchical patterns and features from raw input data. By sliding the filter across the input and performing element-wise multiplications and summations, convolution captures local dependencies and spatial hierarchies in data, which is crucial for tasks like image recognition, object detection, and other computer vision applications. The process reduces the dimensionality of the data while preserving important spatial relationships, making it more computationally efficient and enabling deeper network architectures.

Historical Overview:
The concept of convolution has its roots in mathematics and signal processing, dating back to the early 19th century. However, its application in neural networks gained prominence with the advent of CNNs in the late 20th century. The breakthrough work by Yann LeCun and his colleagues in the 1980s and 1990s, particularly with the LeNet architecture for digit recognition, marked the beginning of convolution's widespread use in AI and deep learning.

Key Contributors:
Yann LeCun is a pivotal figure in the development of convolutional neural networks, alongside his collaborators like Yoshua Bengio and Geoffrey Hinton, who further advanced the field with their contributions to deep learning. The seminal work on LeNet by LeCun et al. demonstrated the effectiveness of convolutional operations in recognizing handwritten digits, laying the groundwork for modern CNN architectures.
