title: ReAct (Reason+Act)
summary: AI framework for integrating reasoning and acting capabilities, enabling models to make decisions based on both logic and learned actions.
---
ReAct, short for "Reason+Act," is a framework designed to enhance AI systems by combining logical reasoning with action-taking capabilities. This approach allows AI models to not only process and interpret information but also to make decisions and take appropriate actions based on that reasoning. It integrates symbolic reasoning, which involves logic and rule-based processing, with the ability to learn from data and adapt actions accordingly. This hybrid method aims to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of AI in complex environments where both understanding and action are crucial. ReAct is particularly significant in applications such as robotics, autonomous systems, and complex problem-solving tasks where dynamic and adaptive decision-making is essential.

Historical Overview:
The concept of combining reasoning and acting in AI has roots in early AI research from the 1980s, but the specific term "ReAct" and its formalization as a distinct framework have gained prominence more recently, particularly with advancements in machine learning and robotics in the late 2010s and early 2020s. This approach reflects a broader trend towards integrating different AI methodologies to handle complex, real-world tasks more effectively.

Key Contributors:
Key contributors to the development of the ReAct framework include researchers in the fields of AI and robotics, such as those from leading institutions like MIT, Stanford, and organizations such as OpenAI and DeepMind. Notable figures include Leslie Kaelbling and Tomás Lozano-Pérez for their work on integrated planning and acting in robotics, and the research teams behind hybrid AI systems that blend symbolic reasoning with machine learning.
