title: Promptocracy
summary: Theoretical governance model where decision-making is guided by AI-generated prompts based on large datasets and probabilistic models.
---
Promptocracy is a concept introduced by Nassim Nicholas Taleb that explores the potential of using AI to guide political and governance decisions. This model leverages large language models (LLMs) like GPT, which analyze extensive datasets to generate decision-making prompts. The idea is rooted in the premise that AI can provide nuanced, data-driven insights that might be less biased and more comprehensive than human judgement alone. The application of Promptocracy is envisioned in scenarios requiring complex, multi-factorial analysis, such as economic policy, public health, and environmental regulation. It emphasizes the importance of probabilistic rigor and the management of uncertainty, aiming to mitigate the risks inherent in traditional human-centric governance.

Historical Overview: The term "Promptocracy" emerged in 2023, gaining attention through Taleb's discussions and writings on the limitations and potential of AI in decision-making. It reflects ongoing debates in the AI community about the role of advanced AI in augmenting or even replacing certain human decision-making processes.

Key Contributors: Nassim Nicholas Taleb, a renowned scholar in risk analysis and complexity theory, is the principal figure behind the concept of Promptocracy. His work integrates ideas from information theory, complexity science, and probabilistic modeling to propose innovative approaches to governance and decision-making​ (Nassim Taleb)​​ (Nassim Taleb)​​ (Nassim Taleb)​.
