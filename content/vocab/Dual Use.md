title: "Dual Use"
summary: "Technologies developed for civilian purposes that can also be repurposed for military or malicious applications, highlighting ethical considerations in their development and regulation."

The concept of dual use is critical in AI ethics and governance, as it addresses the ethical dilemma and security risks associated with the development of artificial intelligence technologies. Technologies that are initially designed for beneficial purposes, such as improving healthcare, enhancing productivity, or advancing scientific research, can also be adapted for harmful uses, including surveillance, autonomous weapons, and cyberattacks. This duality poses significant challenges for policymakers, researchers, and practitioners in ensuring that AI advances society positively without facilitating or exacerbating harm. Strategies to mitigate dual use risks include rigorous ethical review processes, transparent research practices, and international cooperation on norms and regulations for AI technologies.

Historical overview: The concept of dual use is not new and has been discussed in various contexts, including biological research and nuclear technology, for decades. However, its relevance to AI has become more pronounced in the 21st century as AI technologies have rapidly advanced and proliferated.

Key contributors: While there are no single figures universally credited with identifying the dual-use dilemma in AI, the concept has been a focal point for numerous AI ethics scholars, policy advisors, and international bodies. Organizations such as the Future of Life Institute, the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, and the IEEE have played pivotal roles in highlighting the importance of addressing dual use in the context of AI development and governance.
