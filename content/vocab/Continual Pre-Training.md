title: "Continual Pre-Training"
summary: "Process of incrementally training a pre-trained ML model on new data or tasks to update its knowledge without forgetting previously learned information."
---
Continual pre-training is a technique used in machine learning, especially in the context of natural language processing and computer vision, to adapt a model that has already been trained on a large dataset to continually learn from new streams of data or tasks. This approach is essential for maintaining and improving the modelâ€™s relevance and performance over time. It helps overcome the problem of catastrophic forgetting, where a model loses the ability to perform tasks it was previously trained on when new data or tasks are introduced. Continual pre-training typically involves methods like elastic weight consolidation, rehearsal strategies, or dynamically expanding the model's architecture, allowing the model to preserve old capabilities while acquiring new ones.

Historical Overview: The concept of continual learning has been around since the late 1980s, but the specific focus on "continual pre-training" within the context of pre-trained models became more prominent around the mid-2010s with the rise of transformer-based models in AI. Its relevance has increased as these models have become central to many AI applications, necessitating ongoing updates.

Key Contributors: Significant contributions to the theory and practice of continual learning have come from numerous researchers across the field of AI. The development of practical techniques for continual pre-training, particularly in deep learning contexts, has involved contributions from teams at major AI research organizations such as Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and various academic institutions worldwide. Specific advancements often build on foundational work in neural network adaptability and memory consolidation.
