title: Occam's Razor
summary: Principle that, among competing models with similar predictive power, the simplest one should be chosen.
---
Detailed Explanation: In the context of artificial intelligence and machine learning, Occam's Razor is applied to model selection, emphasizing the preference for simpler models that avoid overfitting. The principle suggests that simpler models, which have fewer parameters and assumptions, are generally more robust and generalize better to new, unseen data. This is crucial in AI because overly complex models can fit the noise in the training data rather than the underlying pattern, leading to poor performance on new data. The concept encourages the development of parsimonious models that achieve a balance between complexity and predictive accuracy, facilitating interpretability and ease of implementation.

Historical Overview: The principle is attributed to the 14th-century philosopher William of Ockham, although its application to scientific and mathematical modeling became prominent in the 20th century. In AI, the concept gained traction with the development of statistical learning theories and the formalization of model selection criteria in the latter half of the 20th century.

Key Contributors: William of Ockham is credited with the original formulation of the principle. In AI, key contributors include statisticians and computer scientists such as Vladimir Vapnik and Alexey Chervonenkis, who developed the VC (Vapnik-Chervonenkis) theory, which provides a theoretical foundation for understanding the trade-off between model complexity and performance.
