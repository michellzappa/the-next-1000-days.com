Structured data is essential in the field of AI as it allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and analysis, which are foundational for machine learning models and data-driven decision-making processes. It is characterized by its organization into predefined models, such as tables with rows and columns in relational databases, where each data field is discrete and adheres to a specific data type and constraints. This high level of organization and predictability makes structured data ideal for tasks that require precision and speed in data processing, enabling algorithms to perform complex queries and analyses with relative ease. Structured data formats are widely used in various applications, including financial records, inventory management, and customer relationship management systems, where consistency and accuracy in data handling are paramount.

Historical overview: The concept of structured data has been around since the early days of computing, but it gained prominence with the advent of relational databases in the 1970s, pioneered by Edgar F. Codd's work on the relational model. This period marked the beginning of structured data's widespread adoption in information technology systems, facilitating the organized storage and efficient processing of data.

Key contributors: Edgar F. Codd, an English computer scientist working at IBM, is a key figure in the development of structured data concepts, particularly through his seminal work on the relational database model, which laid the foundation for structured data management and manipulation.
