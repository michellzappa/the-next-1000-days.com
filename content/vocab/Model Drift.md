title: "Model Drift"
summary: "Change in the underlying data patterns that a ML model was trained on, leading to a decrease in the model's accuracy and effectiveness over time."

Model drift is a significant challenge in machine learning and data science, where the statistical properties of the target variable, which the model is trying to predict, change over time. This can be due to various reasons, such as changes in consumer behavior, economic factors, or the introduction of new data sources. Model drift necessitates ongoing monitoring and updating of machine learning models to ensure they continue to perform as expected. Detecting and addressing model drift is crucial for applications in dynamic environments, such as fraud detection, stock price prediction, and customer behavior modeling, where patterns can shift rapidly.

Historical overview: The concept of model drift has been acknowledged since the early days of machine learning application in dynamic environments, but it became more prominent with the widespread adoption of machine learning models in various industries in the 21st century, particularly in the 2010s as data sources grew and became more volatile.

Key contributors: There are no specific individuals uniquely associated with the concept of model drift, as it is a phenomenon that has been observed and addressed by numerous data scientists and researchers across the field of machine learning. However, the development of techniques to detect and correct for model drift is an ongoing area of research within the machine learning community.
