title: "Inference"
summary: "Process by which a trained neural network applies learned patterns to new, unseen data to make predictions or decisions."

Inference in the context of neural networks involves using a model that has been trained on a dataset to predict outcomes for new, unseen data. This process is critical in practical applications of AI, as it determines the model's ability to generalize from its training to real-world data. Inference can be performed on various scales, from lightweight models on mobile devices to large-scale models in cloud environments, depending on the complexity of the task and the computational resources available. The efficiency and speed of inference are crucial for applications requiring real-time processing, such as autonomous vehicles, real-time translation, and interactive AI systems.

Historical Overview: The concept of inference, as applied in neural networks, has been intrinsic to the field of AI since its inception. However, the significance and practical applications of inference have expanded dramatically with the advent of deep learning in the 2010s, where models have become sufficiently sophisticated to be deployed in a wide array of real-world tasks.

Key Contributors: The development of neural network inference techniques has been a collaborative effort involving many researchers and organizations worldwide. Notable figures include Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio, and Yann LeCun, who have been pivotal in the advancements of deep learning technologies that underpin modern inference methods.
