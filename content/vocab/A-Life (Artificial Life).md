Artificial life (A-Life) is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on understanding life through the medium of artificial constructs. It employs computer simulations, robotics, and biochemistry to model and replicate biological processes, aiming to uncover the principles underlying natural life and to explore the potential for life-like behaviors in artificial systems. A-Life encompasses a broad range of studies, including the evolution of digital organisms, the dynamics of ecosystems, the origins of life, and the principles of complex adaptive systems. This field is significant for its contributions to theoretical biology, providing a testbed for hypotheses about natural life, and for its practical applications in software and robotics, where principles derived from natural life are applied to develop more adaptive and robust systems.

Historical overview: The concept of artificial life can be traced back to the automata theories of the 18th century, but it gained formal recognition as a scientific field in the late 20th century, notably through the work of Chris Langton, who is often credited with coining the term "artificial life" in the 1980s.

Key contributors: Chris Langton is a key figure in the development of A-Life, having organized the first "Artificial Life" workshop in 1987 and contributed significantly to the field's theoretical foundation. Other notable contributors include John Conway, with his "Game of Life," a cellular automaton that illustrates how complex patterns can emerge from simple rules, and Thomas Ray, who developed Tierra, a computer simulation demonstrating evolutionary principles through digital organisms.
