title: Contextual Retrieval
summary: AI-driven search technique that retrieves information based on the broader context of a query, rather than relying solely on exact keywords or phrases.

**2. Expert-level explanation:** Contextual retrieval leverages natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to better understand the semantics of a query, focusing on intent, surrounding context, and relationships between terms. It moves beyond traditional keyword-based search by incorporating factors like user history, location, or the structure of documents, thus delivering more relevant and personalized results. This technique is particularly useful in domains like conversational AI, recommendation systems, and information retrieval, where understanding the meaning behind queries leads to more accurate and context-aware results. By integrating contextual cues, these systems can better infer user needs and improve search accuracy in complex or ambiguous scenarios.

**3. Historical overview:** The concept of contextual retrieval emerged alongside advancements in NLP and machine learning in the late 2000s, gaining popularity in the 2010s with the rise of intelligent virtual assistants and search engines like Google, which began incorporating context into their algorithms.

**4. Key contributors:** Significant contributors to contextual retrieval include companies like Google and Microsoft, who applied early NLP models and machine learning techniques to search engines. Academic researchers in the fields of information retrieval and natural language processing, such as Christopher Manning and Andrew Ng, also played key roles in advancing the underlying technologies.
