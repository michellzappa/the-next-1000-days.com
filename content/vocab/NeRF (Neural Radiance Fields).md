Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) represents a groundbreaking approach in computer vision, leveraging the power of deep neural networks to synthesize highly detailed 3D scenes from a collection of 2D photographs. Unlike traditional 3D reconstruction methods that often require manual intervention or fail to capture intricate details, NeRF models the volumetric scene as a continuous function. This function maps spatial coordinates and viewing directions to color and density, using a neural network to predict the radiance emitted in any direction from any point in space. When integrated over a camera's view, this method can produce photorealistic 3D renderings. NeRF's capability to handle complex light interactions like reflections and shadows has opened new avenues in virtual reality, augmented reality, and visual effects industries.

Historical overview: The concept of Neural Radiance Fields was introduced in 2020 by Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P. Srinivasan, Matthew Tancik, Jonathan T. Barron, Ravi Ramamoorthi, and Ren Ng. It rapidly gained popularity due to its impressive ability to reconstruct 3D scenes with high fidelity from a relatively sparse set of images.

Key contributors: The original paper, titled "NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View Synthesis," was the collective work of researchers primarily from the University of California, Berkeley, and Google Research. Ben Mildenhall, Pratul P. Srinivasan, and Matthew Tancik, along with their co-authors, played crucial roles in developing and popularizing the NeRF technique.
