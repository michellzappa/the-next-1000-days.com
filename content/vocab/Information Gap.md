Expert-Level Explanation: In the context of AI and data science, an information gap can significantly impact the accuracy and effectiveness of models and analyses. Information gaps arise due to incomplete, missing, or inaccessible data, and they can lead to biases, incorrect conclusions, and suboptimal decisions. Addressing these gaps often involves data collection, data imputation techniques, or leveraging auxiliary data sources to fill in missing pieces. Understanding and managing information gaps is crucial for building robust AI systems and ensuring the integrity of insights derived from data.

Historical Overview: The concept of an information gap has been relevant in various fields for decades, but it gained significant traction in data science and AI in the 21st century as data-driven decision-making became more prevalent. The term started being prominently used as the complexity and scale of data increased, highlighting the challenges of incomplete information in big data environments.

Key Contributors: While there isn't a single key figure associated with the inception of the term "information gap," the evolution of the concept has been influenced by contributions from data scientists, statisticians, and AI researchers who have worked on data quality, data integration, and the development of methods to handle missing data. Notable figures in the broader field of data science, such as John Tukey and Edward Tufte, have emphasized the importance of accurate and comprehensive data for analysis.
