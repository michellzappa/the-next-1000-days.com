title: "Fabless"
summary: "Company which designs and markets hardware while outsourcing the manufacturing of silicon wafers and chips to specialized semiconductor foundries."

Fabless companies represent a business model in the semiconductor industry where the company focuses on the design and development of integrated circuits (ICs) and other semiconductor products, but does not own or operate its own semiconductor fabrication facilities (fabs). This model allows such companies to minimize capital investment and overhead costs associated with running a fab, which are typically very high due to the sophisticated equipment and technology required. Instead, fabless companies rely on foundry partners to manufacture the chips, enabling them to concentrate on innovation in chip design, efficiency improvements, and quick adaptation to market demands. This approach not only reduces the entry barriers for new companies but also accelerates the pace of technological advancement within the industry.

Historical Overview: The fabless model emerged in the 1980s, with notable growth in the 1990s as companies like Qualcomm and NVIDIA adopted this approach. This model became increasingly popular as the cost and complexity of semiconductor manufacturing escalated, making it financially challenging for many companies to maintain their own fabs.

Key Contributors: Significant early adopters and promoters of the fabless model include companies like NVIDIA, which was founded in 1993, and Qualcomm. These companies have not only succeeded under this model but have also driven much of the innovation in their respective areas, impacting the broader landscape of technology and semiconductor manufacturing.
