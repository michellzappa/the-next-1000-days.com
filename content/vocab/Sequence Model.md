summary: Model designed to process and predict sequences of data, such as time series, text, or biological sequences.

Detailed Explanation
Sequence models are integral to various applications in natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition, and bioinformatics. These models work by taking a sequence of inputs and learning dependencies or patterns within them to make predictions about future elements or generate new sequences. Examples of sequence models include Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and Transformers. RNNs can handle arbitrary-length sequences by maintaining a hidden state that gets updated at each time step, capturing temporal dependencies. LSTMs enhance this by using gates to manage the flow of information, effectively learning longer-term dependencies. Transformers, on the other hand, leverage self-attention mechanisms to capture relationships within sequences without relying on sequential data processing, significantly improving performance and scalability for tasks like machine translation and text generation.

Historical Overview
The concept of sequence models emerged in the 1980s with early neural network models, but it gained significant traction in the 1990s with the introduction of RNNs. The development of LSTMs in 1997 by Sepp Hochreiter and Jürgen Schmidhuber marked a significant milestone, addressing the vanishing gradient problem inherent in traditional RNNs. The advent of the Transformer model in 2017 by Vaswani et al. revolutionized the field by enabling more efficient training on large datasets and capturing long-range dependencies more effectively.

Key Contributors
Notable contributors to the development of sequence models include Sepp Hochreiter and Jürgen Schmidhuber for their work on LSTMs, Yoshua Bengio for his contributions to RNNs and sequence-to-sequence models, and Ashish Vaswani along with his colleagues for pioneering the Transformer model. These individuals and their teams have significantly advanced the capabilities and applications of sequence models in AI.
