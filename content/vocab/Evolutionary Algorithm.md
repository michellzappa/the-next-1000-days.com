Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are a subset of evolutionary computation, a family of algorithms for global optimization inspired by biological evolution. They work by iteratively improving a population of candidate solutions with respect to a given measure of quality or fitness. This process involves selection (choosing the best-fit individuals for reproduction), crossover (combining parts of two or more solutions to create a new solution), and mutation (randomly altering parts of a solution to explore the solution space). EAs are particularly useful for problems where the solution space is complex, multimodal, or poorly understood, as they do not require gradient information and can escape local optima. Applications range from engineering design optimization to machine learning model tuning.

The concept of evolutionary algorithms was first introduced in the 1960s, with significant development and popularization occurring in the 1970s and 1980s. These algorithms were inspired by the principles of natural selection and genetics, drawing parallels between biological evolution and computational search and optimization processes.

John Holland is often credited as the father of genetic algorithms, a subset of evolutionary algorithms, introducing them in the 1960s. His work laid the foundation for the development of evolutionary algorithms, influencing subsequent research and applications in various fields. Other notable contributors include Ingo Rechenberg and Hans-Paul Schwefel, who developed evolution strategies, another type of evolutionary algorithm, in the 1960s and 1970s.
