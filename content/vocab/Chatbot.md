Chatbots are typically powered by rules-based systems or more advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies such as natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) to interpret and respond to user input. They are used in a variety of settings, including customer service, information acquisition, and entertainment, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for businesses to automate interactions. Advanced chatbots utilize AI to learn from interactions to improve their accuracy and relevance over time, adapting to the preferences and behaviors of their users.

Historical Overview:
The concept of a conversational computer program was popularized with the introduction of ELIZA by Joseph Weizenbaum in 1966. This early chatbot simulated a psychotherapist and operated based on simple pattern matching techniques. The term "chatbot" became more widely recognized and used in the late 1990s as internet-based chat became more prevalent.

Key Contributors:
Joseph Weizenbaum was crucial in developing the early concept of chatbots with his work on ELIZA. Subsequent developments have been influenced by a wide range of researchers in AI, including those working on NLP and ML to improve the sophistication and applicability of chatbots in various domains.
