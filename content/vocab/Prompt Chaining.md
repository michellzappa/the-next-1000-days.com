title: Prompt Chaining
summary: Technique in AI and ML where multiple prompts or tasks are sequentially connected, allowing the output of one step to become the input for the next, effectively enabling more complex and nuanced operations.

**Detailed Explanation**: In prompt chaining, a sequence of prompts is used to guide a language model through a series of related tasks, often in a step-by-step manner. This technique leverages the model's ability to process context from previous prompts, enabling it to perform more sophisticated tasks that would be difficult to achieve with a single prompt. For instance, in a multi-step reasoning task, the first prompt might generate a hypothesis, the second prompt refines it, and subsequent prompts might evaluate and adjust the outcome, leading to a more accurate or insightful final result. This method is particularly valuable in tasks requiring multi-turn dialogue, logical reasoning, or detailed procedural generation, where a single prompt might not suffice to capture all the nuances or required steps.

**Historical Overview**: The concept of chaining tasks is rooted in earlier programming paradigms but gained specific relevance in the context of language models around the early 2020s, as large-scale models like GPT-3 demonstrated their capacity for complex, multi-step reasoning. The practice of prompt chaining became more formally recognized as users explored ways to extend the capabilities of these models beyond simple, one-off prompts.

**Key Contributors**: The development of prompt chaining as a technique is largely attributed to the broader AI and ML community experimenting with generative models like OpenAI's GPT series. Researchers and practitioners exploring the boundaries of these models have contributed to the refinement and popularization of this approach, with significant work done by AI researchers at OpenAI and other leading AI labs.
