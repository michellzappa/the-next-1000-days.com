title: "Reranking"
summary: "Process in which an initial set of items retrieved by a search algorithm is resorted using a secondary criterion or algorithm to better match user expectations or specific criteria."

Reranking is a crucial component in information retrieval systems, particularly in search engines and recommender systems. After an initial retrieval phase, where a broad set of potentially relevant items is selected based on basic matching criteria (such as keyword matches), reranking applies more sophisticated metrics or models to reorder these items. This second stage often utilizes machine learning algorithms that can incorporate a variety of signals such as user behavior, contextual relevance, and content quality. The objective is to improve the relevance and quality of the results presented to the user, focusing on precision at the top of the results list where it is most visible and impactful.

Historical Overview: The concept of reranking emerged prominently in the early 2000s with the advancement of search engine technologies and the increasing complexity of user queries and expectations. It became more significant as algorithms and computing power evolved to handle more nuanced assessments of data.

Key Contributors: While no single individual or group can be credited exclusively for the development of reranking, it has been a focal area of research within major tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and academic institutions involved in information retrieval studies. The evolution of reranking techniques has been closely tied to advancements in machine learning and natural language processing communities.
