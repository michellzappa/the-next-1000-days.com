title: Meta Prompt
summary: AI technique that emphasizes the structural and syntactical framework of prompts to guide models in problem-solving and task execution, prioritizing the 'how' of information presentation over the 'what'.

Expert-level Explanation: At its core, meta prompting represents an advanced prompting strategy that transcends conventional prompt engineering by adopting a high-level, abstract approach. This method encourages AI models to generalize across different tasks by understanding the underlying structure of prompts, thus enabling a more versatile and adaptive response mechanism. The technique is rooted in meta-learning concepts, where models are trained not just on specific tasks but on learning how to learn or adapt to new tasks efficiently. Meta prompting leverages this by employing a hierarchical model structure, where a primary "Meta Model" orchestrates the integration of insights from domain-specific models or experts, effectively synthesizing a collective response to complex queries or tasks. This orchestration mirrors the functionality of an ensemble approach, capitalizing on the diversity and specialization of individual models to produce a comprehensive and accurate output​[](https://github.com/meta-prompting/meta-prompting)​​[](https://flowgpt.gitbook.io/prompt-engineering-guide/group-8/advanced-topics-in-prompt-engineering/meta-learning-and-meta-prompts)​​[](https://ar5iv.org/abs/2401.12954)​.

Historical Overview: While the precise origins of meta prompting as a distinct concept are not clearly delineated, the technique has gained significant attention in recent years, especially with the advent of more sophisticated AI models like GPT-3 and GPT-4. These developments have enabled more complex interactions between models and prompts, paving the way for meta prompting's emergence as a key area of exploration in AI research and application.

Key Contributors: The development of meta prompting is a collective effort within the AI research community, with contributions spanning multiple institutions and research groups. While specific individuals are not singled out in the provided sources, the technique is closely associated with advancements in language models and prompt engineering, fields that have seen significant contributions from researchers affiliated with leading AI research labs and universities.

Significance and Applications: Meta prompting is particularly beneficial in domains requiring complex reasoning, problem-solving, and adaptive learning. It finds applications in educational technology, where it aids in structuring learning and problem-solving approaches, and in software development, where it can guide the development of algorithms and solutions to complex programming challenges. The method's adaptability and focus on structural understanding make it a powerful tool for enhancing AI systems' capabilities in dealing with multifaceted and dynamic tasks​[](https://github.com/meta-prompting/meta-prompting)​.
