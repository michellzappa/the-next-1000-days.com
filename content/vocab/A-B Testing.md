A/B testing, also known as split testing, is an experimental approach commonly used in digital marketing, product development, and user experience research. It involves randomly assigning participants into two groups: one group (A) is exposed to the control version of a variable, while the other group (B) is exposed to a modified version. By analyzing the performance metrics of each group, researchers can determine which version yields better results in terms of predefined criteria, such as click-through rates, conversion rates, or user engagement. A/B testing is critical for data-driven decision-making as it provides empirical evidence about the effectiveness of changes to products, websites, or marketing strategies.

Historical Overview:
The concept of A/B testing has roots in the field of controlled experiments in statistics, but it became widely recognized in the digital world in the early 2000s with the rise of online marketing and e-commerce. Its popularity surged as companies like Google and Amazon utilized it to optimize their platforms, leading to more widespread adoption.

Key Contributors:
Key contributors to the development and popularization of A/B testing include pioneers in digital marketing and tech companies. Ronny Kohavi, a prominent figure in this space, significantly advanced the methodology during his tenure at Microsoft and later at Amazon. Additionally, the adoption and refinement of A/B testing by major companies like Google and Facebook played a crucial role in its evolution and widespread use.
