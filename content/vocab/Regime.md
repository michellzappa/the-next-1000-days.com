title: Regime
summary: Distinct operational or behavioral mode in which an AI system functions, characterized by specific patterns or properties of data, parameters, or algorithms.

A regime in AI often denotes a specific phase or condition under which an AI model operates, particularly in terms of learning and performance. For instance, during the training of a machine learning model, different regimes might be observed, such as the initial rapid learning phase, a plateau phase where learning slows down, or a fine-tuning phase with minimal performance gains. These regimes can also be defined by the characteristics of the input data, such as regimes of high or low variance, which can significantly impact the model's behavior and effectiveness. Understanding and identifying these regimes is crucial for optimizing model performance, selecting appropriate hyperparameters, and ensuring robust generalization to new data.

Historical Overview
The term "regime" has been used in various scientific fields for decades, but its specific application in AI gained traction in the 2000s as machine learning and neural networks became more complex. Researchers observed that AI systems exhibited distinct learning patterns and behaviors under different conditions, prompting the use of "regime" to describe these phases.

Key Contributors
Key contributors to the concept of regimes in AI include researchers in the fields of machine learning and statistical learning theory, such as Vladimir Vapnik, who laid foundational work in understanding the behavior of learning algorithms. Additionally, the widespread research and publications by institutions like Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and academic researchers have significantly advanced the understanding of different regimes in AI system performance.
