title: "Sovereign AI"
summary: "Hypothetical form of AI that operates independently with its own autonomy, potentially possessing the ability to make decisions and take actions without human intervention."
---
Sovereign AI represents an advanced stage of AI development where systems are not only self-sufficient in performing tasks but also have the capability to understand, conceptualize, and interact with the world in a manner akin to human-level intelligence or beyond. This concept raises significant ethical, governance, and safety considerations, as such AIs would need robust frameworks for decision-making that align with human values and societal norms. The discussion around Sovereign AI intersects with debates on AI alignment, control problem, and the broader implications of artificial general intelligence (AGI) on society.

Historical overview: Discussions about AI with a high degree of autonomy and decision-making capability have been part of the theoretical landscape since the early days of artificial intelligence research, but the term "Sovereign AI" and its conceptualization as an independent entity with its own ‘sovereignty’ have emerged more prominently in discussions related to AGI in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

Key contributors: While it is challenging to pinpoint specific individuals responsible for the concept of Sovereign AI due to its speculative nature and broad discussion across the AI community, figures such as Nick Bostrom and Eliezer Yudkowsky have significantly contributed to the discourse on advanced AI ethics and risks, which includes considerations related to Sovereign AI.
