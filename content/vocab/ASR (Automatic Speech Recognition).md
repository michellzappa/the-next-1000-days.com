title: "ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition)"
summary: "Translates spoken language into written text, enabling computers to understand and process human speech."

ASR systems utilize a combination of acoustic and language modeling to interpret the audio signals of speech. Acoustic modeling maps audio signals to phonetic units or speech sounds, while language modeling uses statistical techniques to predict word sequences, improving the system's accuracy by considering the context and the likelihood of certain word combinations. This technology underpins a wide array of applications, from voice-activated assistants and dictation software to real-time transcription and automated customer service systems. Advances in deep learning and neural network architectures have significantly improved ASR accuracy and efficiency, making it a cornerstone of accessible and natural human-computer interaction.

Historical overview: The concept of ASR dates back to the 1950s, with Bell Laboratories' Audrey system being one of the first efforts in 1952, capable of recognizing digits spoken by a single voice. The technology gained significant momentum in the late 20th century, particularly with the introduction of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) in the 1980s, which enhanced the ability of ASR systems to deal with variable speech patterns.

Key contributors: Several researchers and institutions have played pivotal roles in ASR development. Raj Reddy's work at Carnegie Mellon University in the 1970s on speech understanding systems marked significant progress. James Baker and Janet Baker, for their part in developing HMM-based speech recognition at Dragon Systems in the 1980s, and Geoffrey Hinton's contributions to deep learning applications in ASR during the 21st century, have been fundamental in advancing ASR technology.
