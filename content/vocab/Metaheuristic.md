title: Metaheuristic
summary: High-level problem-independent algorithmic framework that provides a set of guidelines or strategies to develop heuristic optimization algorithms.
---
Metaheuristics are designed to solve complex optimization problems by guiding subordinate heuristics to explore the solution space efficiently. Unlike exact algorithms that guarantee finding the optimal solution, metaheuristics aim to find good enough solutions within a reasonable timeframe, often where traditional methods fail due to problem size or complexity. Common examples include Genetic Algorithms, Simulated Annealing, and Ant Colony Optimization. These methods balance exploration and exploitation through mechanisms such as mutation, crossover, local search, and pheromone trails, allowing them to escape local optima and approach global optima.

Historical Overview: The term "metaheuristic" was first introduced in the late 1980s and early 1990s, gaining significant traction in the optimization community as the limitations of traditional optimization methods became apparent. The concept grew in popularity throughout the 1990s and 2000s, coinciding with advances in computational power and the increasing complexity of problems in fields such as logistics, engineering, and bioinformatics.

Key Contributors: Key figures in the development of metaheuristics include Marco Dorigo, who developed Ant Colony Optimization, John Holland, known for Genetic Algorithms, and Fred Glover, who introduced Tabu Search. Their work laid the foundational principles and demonstrated the efficacy of metaheuristic approaches in tackling complex optimization problems across various domains.
