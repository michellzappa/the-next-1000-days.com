title: "Reflective Programming"
summary: "Programming paradigm that allows a program to inspect and modify its own structure and behavior at runtime."

Reflective programming is significant in AI and software development because it enables systems to adapt to new circumstances, self-optimize, or modify their behavior based on introspection and external conditions without needing explicit instructions for every possible scenario. This capability is particularly valuable in AI for implementing systems that can adjust their algorithms or strategies based on their performance or changing environments, enhancing their autonomy and effectiveness. It underpins dynamic modification of code, which can be used for optimization, customization, or adapting AI models to specific tasks dynamically.

Historical overview: The concept of reflection in computing has its roots in the Lisp programming language, developed in the late 1950s, which included features for self-inspection and manipulation of code as data. However, the formal exploration and definition of reflective programming became more prominent in research and literature in the 1980s, with languages like Smalltalk providing comprehensive support for reflection.

Key contributors: While reflective programming is a broad concept that has evolved over time, significant contributions have been made by researchers and developers in the Lisp and Smalltalk communities. For instance, the development of the Lisp language by John McCarthy and others laid foundational work for reflective capabilities in programming, while the Smalltalk community, led by figures such as Alan Kay, further advanced the development and application of reflective programming techniques.
