Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) technology is a groundbreaking field that focuses on developing direct communication pathways between a user's brain and external devices, bypassing conventional neuromuscular channels. This technology has significant applications in assisting individuals with disabilities, enhancing human-computer interaction, and even in entertainment and gaming. BCIs work by interpreting patterns of brain activity, which can be captured through various methods such as electroencephalography (EEG), and translating them into commands that control external devices or software. The technology is not only a testament to the advances in understanding neural signals but also a step towards integrating artificial intelligence in augmenting human capabilities and rehabilitation.

Historical overview: The concept of BCIs has been explored since the 1970s, but it gained significant traction in the late 1990s and early 2000s as technology for measuring and interpreting brain activity became more sophisticated and accessible.

Key contributors: Although many researchers have contributed to the field of BCI, notable figures include Jonathan Wolpaw, who has been pivotal in developing non-invasive BCI technologies, and Miguel Nicolelis, known for his work on invasive BCI systems that allow direct brain control of robotic limbs.
