title: "Hybrid AI"
summary: "Combines symbolic AI (rule-based systems) and sub-symbolic AI (machine learning) approaches to leverage the strengths of both for more versatile and explainable AI systems."
---
Hybrid AI aims to bridge the gap between the interpretability, logical reasoning, and domain knowledge integration of symbolic AI, and the learning capabilities, adaptability, and efficiency in handling unstructured data of sub-symbolic AI (primarily neural networks). This amalgamation facilitates AI systems that can not only learn from data but also understand and manipulate abstract concepts within a structured knowledge framework. Such systems are particularly promising for complex decision-making tasks, offering a blend of data-driven insights and rule-based constraints. This approach enhances AI's explainability, reliability, and ability to interact with the world in a more human-like manner, making it a key area of interest for advancing towards more general forms of AI.

Historical overview: The concept of Hybrid AI is not new and has roots in the early days of AI research. However, it gained significant attention in the 2010s as the limitations of purely machine learning or purely symbolic approaches became apparent in solving complex, real-world problems.

Key contributors: No single individual or group can be credited with the development of Hybrid AI, as it is a broad field that has evolved through the contributions of many researchers across different disciplines. However, organizations like DeepMind and research initiatives in various universities around the world have been at the forefront of exploring and advancing Hybrid AI technologies.
