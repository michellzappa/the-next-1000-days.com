# Temporal Thinking

## Thinking across timescales by treating language as a moving signal.

In foresight work, I use AI to explore how present signals might evolve into possible futures. I feed it events, patterns, and emerging ideas, and ask for their longer-term implications. This expands my imagination beyond the immediate, grounding speculation in structured reasoning.

#### Field note — Language Vectorization (N-098)

I asked an AI to “vectorize” how language shifted over the past century and project a plausible register for 2125, then write short vignettes in that style. The exercise stretched the model beyond summaries, into tone, rhythm, and symbol play. Treating language as a moving signal made temporal scenarios feel embodied rather than abstract.
