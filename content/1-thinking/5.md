# Comparative Analysis

## Weighing trade‑offs with framing as a first‑class variable.

When weighing options, I use AI to map pros, cons, and implications. It helps me see trade-offs in design choices, business models, or even personal directions. The clarity comes from externalizing the reasoning process and seeing it organized without the noise of preference or emotion.

Small framing changes can measurably shift outcomes. During one set of tests, I compared otherwise identical prompts that differed only by a “tip” cue—an incentive nudge reported to increase adherence to constraints. The results weren’t magic, but they were real: tighter conformity to format and fewer omissions. It’s a reminder that models are sensitive to framing; comparative analysis should include prompt framing as a variable, not just content.
