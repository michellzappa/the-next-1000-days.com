# Feedback Loops
## What are feedback loops


Slide-68.webp

An agent is a decision-making intelligence that observes things about the environment and then makes changes or acts differently depending on what it sees and the outcome it wants to optimize for. This goes into a feedback loop. We don't have many examples of agents right now. There are a few things in business automation, but within creative AIs, there’s not much. I think that edge is being explored as we speak. They’re trying to achieve certain goals and optimize for certain problems using whatever means are available.
