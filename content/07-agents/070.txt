* What are agents?
* How can you use them?
* How do you build one?
* What happens when they coordinate among each other?


When systems know and act. This is where we start to see AI moving towards greater independence, a direct extension of the coding capabilities we've just explored.

What are agents? At their core, they're AI systems with a control function, capable of perceiving their environment, making decisions, and taking actions to achieve specific goals. They represent a shift from AI as a passive tool to an active participant in tasks and processes.

The implications are profound. What used to take weeks can now be done in minutes. We're seeing this in various domains - from customer service chatbots to autonomous vehicles, from code generation to data analysis.

But it's not just about automation. Agents are becoming more sophisticated, capable of interacting with each other and with humans in complex ways. This opens up new possibilities for collaboration and problem-solving that we're only beginning to explore.

Personal experience has shown me the potential of agents. I've used custom GPTs for tasks like content creation, summarizing videos, and even assisting with tenders. The key is to identify specific, well-defined tasks where agents can truly shine.

Looking ahead, we can expect to see agents in virtually every sector by 2025. Security, customer service, employee assistance, creative tasks, data analysis, coding, finance, healthcare, education - the list goes on. Everyone will have access to proactive, independent AI agents.

This chapter will delve into the current state of AI agents, their potential applications, and the challenges and opportunities they present. We'll also consider the broader implications of increasingly autonomous AI systems. How will this change our work, our organizations, and our society?

Remember, with great power comes great responsibility. As we develop more capable agents, we need to carefully consider the ethical implications and potential risks. The goal should be to create agents that augment and empower humans, not replace them.
