# Thinking

## How shared reasoning expands awareness.

How AI extends my cognition: framing, clarifying, and exploring ideas.

Thinking with AI shifts the experience of thought itself. The act of articulating what you believe, and watching it reflected back, expands understanding in real time. What once felt private becomes a shared exploration, where clarity is a side effect of attention.

### Think in Dialogue

> Intelligence changes when it becomes conversational. Instead of writing for later revision, the centaur writes to see thought unfold in real time. Dialogue reveals assumptions faster than silence ever could. By letting language loop between human and model, the mind learns to observe itself thinking.
