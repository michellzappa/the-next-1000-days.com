# Concept Refinement

When an idea is still forming, I use AI as a sparring partner to clarify what it is and what it is not. I describe the thought in rough terms and let it ask questions or reframe it in alternate language. This exchange often reveals the core of the idea hidden beneath unnecessary complexity. Itâ€™s a dialogue that turns intuition into articulation.

# Follow-up Questions

In any conversation, I often ask, "What else should I know?" This helps uncover things you might not have considered. The bias of the system can be used to your advantage, as LLMs have a comprehensive overview of many subjects.
