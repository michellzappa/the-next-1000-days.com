"With LLMs, how you choose to approach them will greatly determine the quality of their responses
Banal questions will receive banal answers
For extraordinary conversations, try to create a space of openness and curiosity"



Here's a brief intro and overview for chapter 4 on prompts, written in your style:

Prompts

How to talk with machines. Prompting is a foundational skill for generative AI, and its importance cannot be overstated. It's the interface between our intentions and the AI's capabilities.

Natural language vs. computer language - prompting sits at this intersection. It's about learning to communicate effectively with AI models, understanding their quirks and limitations, and coaxing out the best possible outputs.

The structure of a prompt matters immensely. A weak prompt like "Write something about AI in education" will yield weak results. A strong prompt defines a persona, provides context, specifies a task, and outlines a desired format. It's about doing the thinking upfront to guide the AI effectively.

Iteration is key. Don't settle for the first response. Compare different models, try variations of your prompt, and build on successful outputs. Remember, these models are stochastic - results can vary, so persistence often pays off.

Custom instructions are another powerful tool in your prompting arsenal. They allow you to shape the AI's behavior more broadly, influencing tone, style, and approach across multiple interactions.

This chapter will dive into practical prompting techniques, common pitfalls to avoid, and strategies for getting the most out of your AI interactions. Mastering this skill is crucial for anyone looking to leverage AI effectively in their work or creative pursuits.

But keep in mind - prompting might be a temporary skill. As these models evolve, we may see a shift where machines learn to better understand and interpret human intent. For now, though, it remains an essential capability for working with AI.
