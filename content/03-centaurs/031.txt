The landmark matches between Garry Kasparov and IBM’s Deep Blue showcased the potential and limits of human vs. machine competition.

A couple of decades ago, there was a famous chess match between the then Grandmaster in chess, Gary Kasparov, and IBM's Deep Blue supercomputer. IBM's marketing team wanted to promote this as a human versus machine event.

After Deep Blue’s victory, the chess world began exploring collaborations between human grandmasters and AI.


The takeaway from the match was that Kasparov lost to Deep Blue. They had played before, and the previous year he played again, but this time he walked out. The story of human versus machine quickly became the dominant narrative.




# what do you know about centaur chess

Centaur chess refers to a type of chess play that involves both human and computer players working together as a team. The human player provides strategic insight and creativity, while the computer provides tactical precision and the ability to analyze large numbers of possible moves. Centaur chess has been shown to be more successful than either humans or computers playing alone, and it is seen as a potential way to bridge the gap between the two. Some notable examples of centaur chess teams are Garry Kasparov and the supercomputer Deep Blue, and the team of GM Rybka and IM Levy.
