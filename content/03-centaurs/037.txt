# Beware Over-reliance


Symbiosis.png

I recently moved in to an apartment with a back yard, and one of the favorite things I've done with the space has been setting up a bird feeder. The first month after placing the peanut & seed mix for our hungry flying friends was slow and we noticed no visitors. Fast forward a few weeks and I am now topping up the feeder daily for a bunch of city birds to feast, giving me something animate and colorful to stare away from the monitor throughout the day.

From the birds' perspective, it's an easy win, and word spreads quickly among the feathered when good food is to be found.

Symbiosis. There are many ways to coexist. We interact with countless species through indirect experience. We are vastly more intelligent than most of these and have exploited that difference to our collective advantage throughout history. We have contained nature and made it obey our will. This feels obvious, yet difficult to see.

I am not suggesting future superintelligences will lure us in with free food for their delight.

I have no reason to believe they will be act with benevolence.

Why would they? 

Everywhere we find a jump in intelligence there is exploitation. Benign use is possible but not expected. Superintelligence is not a guarantee, instead we might experience a long plateau where the next generations of AI tapers off around human-level expertise. Instead of surpassing us, they would complement us. 

The alternative, where superintelligence takes off, is almost impossible to anticipate. If artificial *general* intelligence is our capacity to replace human-level at a large scale, then we don't need superintelligence. If on the other hand we see the state of the art surpass our collective abilities, then we can only guess what happens on the other side.

Mushroom pickers urged to avoid foraging books on Amazon that appear to be written by AI.

All mushrooms are edible onceâ€¦


We must be careful without over-relying on these systems. Last year, there were examples of mushroom picking guides that were generative and sold on Amazon, which is not a great idea. Be careful with fact-checking and trusting your sources because if the author isn't knowledgeable about what they're writing, the AI can be confidently wrong, putting you in danger.

Mutualism
Mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship.

Commensalism
One-sided symbiotic relationship.

Competition
Organisms compete for resources.

Predatory
Where one organism feeds on another.


In conclusion, centaurs are worth considering for their symbiotic potential. Nature has mutually beneficial ways where different species coexist, like mutualism, and scenarios like predatory relationships where one party is unaware of the other. We don't know where centaurs or AI will fall on this spectrum. We must be purposeful in our choices to ensure a beneficial coexistence.

# what are some tools and websites that help people augment their intelligence

There are many tools and websites available that can help people augment their intelligence, some examples include:

- Learning platforms: Websites such as Coursera, Khan Academy, and edX offer a wide range of online courses that cover a variety of subjects, from computer science to history.
- Online tutorials: Websites such as Codecademy, Udemy, and Skillshare provide tutorials on a variety of programming languages, software, and other technical skills.
- Productivity tools: Apps and websites such as Evernote, Trello, and Asana can help people organize their tasks and stay on top of their work.
- Language learning tools: Websites and apps such as Duolingo, Rosetta Stone, and Memrise can help people learn new languages and improve their language skills.
- Mind mapping tools: Websites and apps such as XMind, MindNode, and Coggle can help people organize their thoughts and plan projects.
- Memory aids: Websites and apps such as Anki, SuperMemo, and Quizlet can help people improve their memory and recall information more easily.
- Reading Tools: Tools like Amazon Kindle, Google Books, and Project Gutenberg offer access to a large number of books to read and help individuals to improve their comprehension and vocabulary.
- Artificial intelligence tools: There are many AI-based tools available, such as IBM Watson and Google's AI Platform, that can help people understand and use AI technologies to augment their own intelligence.








# how do humans make the most of computer intelligence


There are several ways for humans to make the most of computer intelligence:

- Leverage the computer's ability to process large amounts of data quickly and accurately: Computers can analyze vast amounts of data and identify patterns that humans might miss. By using computer programs to process data, humans can gain new insights and make more informed decisions.
- Use the computer as a tool: Computers can be used to perform tasks that would be difficult or impossible for humans to do alone, such as simulating complex physical processes or analyzing large amounts of text.
- Take advantage of the computer's ability to perform repetitive tasks: Computers can be programmed to perform tasks repeatedly and accurately, such as running simulations or monitoring data streams. This can free up human time for more complex tasks.
- Use the computer to automate routine tasks: Computers can automate repetitive tasks such as data entry, allowing humans to focus on more important tasks.
- Use the computer to support decision-making: By using computer-based decision support systems, humans can make better decisions by considering a wider range of options and by analyzing data in more depth.
- Leverage the computer's ability to learn from data: Machine learning techniques allow computers to learn from data and improve their performance over time. Humans can make the most of this ability by providing the computer with large amounts of data and by fine-tuning its algorithms.
- Encourage human-computer interaction: by providing the computer with feedback and by adjusting its parameters, humans can train the computer to perform better and adapt to their needs.

Overall, the key is for humans to understand the strengths and limitations of computer intelligence and to use it in a way that complements their own strengths and abilities.
