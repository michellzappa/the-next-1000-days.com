Since 2005, centaur players typically outperform both supercomputers and human grandmasters in blind matches.

For decades in freestyle matches, or blind matches where you don't see your opponent, the best players were those who knew their system the best. It wasn't necessarily the best chess player or the fastest computer, but rather knowing how to interface with your computer more effectively than your opponent.

What’s notable about this combination is that “cyborg” chess masters currently beat both the world’s most skilled humans and the most skilled computers. In other words, the human helps the computer to be better than any computer alone, and the computer helps the human be better than any other human alone. The combination of each is superior to either alone.
And what’s particularly interesting about cyborg chess is that the best cyborg chess players aren’t necessarily all that great at being “just” human chess players themselves! In other words, it’s not just that chess grandmasters become even better with computer assistance, but that some amateur chess players paired with a computer can beat the world’s best chess players paired with a computer – because it takes a different set of skills to excel at cyborg chess than it does to excel at human chess.

What was only supposed at first, became more and more evident between 2005 and 2007: even high-class chess pros
fro m the circle the to p 100 can keep up only in the Freestyle if they are equipped fairly according to computer and dispose of an advanced know-how in dealing with chess programs. Exactly this time and effort avoid, however, most chess pros in spite of the tempting opportunity "to take" en passant a few thousand dollars from the home desk.

If you plot the ELO scores, the best programs in purple outperform the best players in light green, and the best centaurs outperform the best programs. There's a fuzzy line at the very extreme of this, so there are times where programs outperform centaurs, but they're all at the edge of capability when playing together.




# how are centaur players better than humans and computers

Centaur players, which are teams of human and computer players working together, are better than either humans or computers playing alone because they are able to combine the strengths of both.

Humans are good at strategic thinking and creativity, which allows them to come up with unconventional ideas and to understand the overall big picture of the game. They also have a good understanding of the importance of certain positions and are able to make decisions based on the psychology of the opponent.

Computers, on the other hand, are able to analyze large numbers of possible moves very quickly and accurately. They can also find hidden tactical opportunities that humans might miss.

By working together, the human player can guide the computer's analysis towards the most promising lines of play, while the computer can help the human player to evaluate the best move in a given position. This allows the centaur team to make more accurate decisions, and to outplay their opponents by using a combination of human intuition and computer precision.
