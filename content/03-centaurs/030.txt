# Centaurs
## Bicycles for our minds.

* Human-AI synergy instead of replacement.
* Superior performance in collaboration.
* Enhanced decision-making and creativity.
* Subject of research since 2015.


Bicycles for our minds. Human-AI synergy instead of replacement. This is the key to unlocking the true potential of artificial intelligence.

The concept of centaurs isn't new - it's been a subject of research since at least 2015. But it's more relevant now than ever. As AI capabilities grow, so does the potential for human-AI collaboration to achieve superior performance.

Remember Kasparov vs Deep Blue? The real innovation came after, with the rise of advanced chess. Centaur players, combining human intuition with machine calculation, consistently outperform both humans and AI alone. This principle extends far beyond chess.

We're seeing centaur approaches yield impressive results across industries. From consultants using AI to boost productivity and quality, to creative professionals leveraging generative models to expand their capabilities. The key is finding the right balance, the optimal human-AI interface.

Interestingly, AI often acts as a skill leveler. Those with lower baseline performance often see the largest gains from AI augmentation. But even top performers can enhance their abilities through smart collaboration with AI.
