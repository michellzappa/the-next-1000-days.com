# Generating Images

## Crafting fast, consistent visuals with lived practice over tips.

I keep craft notes tight and grounded in lived practice.

### Weekly Covers (N-046)

I illustrate each newsletter cover with AI in minutes. That cadence would have been impossible before: light art direction, one or two iterations, ship. The point isn’t novelty; it’s sustained publishing with consistent tone and evolving visual language.

### Coherence and Style Transfer (N-098)

OpenAI’s 4o image generation changed my baseline expectations. Image‑to‑image coherence and style transfer feel markedly better than diffusion alone. It expands what a small team can do quickly—composited scenes, hybrid styles, believable variations—while watermarking pushes provenance forward.

### One-Shot Repetition

For visuals, repeat a good prompt a few times. Variation across generations is often more useful than micro‑tweaks within one.

### Style Reference Creation

Before a series, I define the style in words—tone, color, composition, intention. Shared language keeps collaborators and tools aligned.

#### Sidebar — Corpus Remixing (N-073)

I uploaded my own newsletter intros to NotebookLM and generated a short podcast. Hearing my voice modeled from my corpus surfaced recurring themes and gaps. Remixing your archive is a fast way to audit tone and evolve style.
