# Generating Images

## Aspect Ratios

Consider how you want to use the output image in terms of its aspect ratio. Generate tall images for smartphones, wide images for desktops or square images when you don’t know - because a single prompt will generate differently framed images depending on its aspect ratio.

- In Dall-E you can ask for horizontal, vertical or square images.
- In MidJourney and Flux you use --aspect 3:2, for example.

## One-Shot Repetition

For images more than text, it's worth repeating the prompt to allow the diffusion model to create a different output. The amount of variation from one generation to the next can be staggering and go in different directions every time.

## Style Reference Creation

Before producing a visual series or collaboration, I use AI to define style in words—tone, color, composition, intention. This shared language becomes the foundation for consistency across tools and collaborators. It’s design through articulation.
