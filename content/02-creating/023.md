# Writing Support

I use AI as a writing companion for essays, newsletters, and chapters. It helps refine clarity, structure arguments, and find natural pacing. The process feels collaborative: I write first, then let AI test coherence and rhythm, suggesting what might be missing rather than rewriting in its own voice.
