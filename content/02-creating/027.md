# Creative Constraint Exercises

## Turning limits into prompts that refresh style and unlock ideas.

Sometimes I ask AI to invent constraints for writing or idea generation: limit the word count, change the perspective, invert the argument. These exercises restore play to the creative process and prevent repetition. They turn thinking into practice.

I’ve also logged hundreds of “prompt hours” crafting image prompts as a discipline, not a demo. Endurance practice—small daily reps, timed sprints, constraint stacks—clarified that prompting is creative writing plus direction. The work is choosing what to say, not chasing magic words.
