# Conceptual Moodboarding

## Turning feelings into form before pixels exist.

I describe an emotion or atmosphere—say, “quiet anticipation” or “technological awe”—and ask AI to suggest sensory cues, materials, or visual metaphors. It translates feeling into form, bridging the abstract and the tangible before design begins.

Constraint stacks help: limit palette, forbid a favorite motif, or shift era while keeping subject constant. Treat the model as an assistant director—responsible for options, not judgment. You choose the take.

When preparing interviews, I let AI propose questions and constraints, then I rewrite. Let the model draft breadth; keep the final tone human and specific.
