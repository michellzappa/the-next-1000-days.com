Path Dependence

Path dependence refers to the idea that the decisions or outcomes we face today are heavily influenced by past events, choices, or established systems, even if those initial conditions are no longer optimal. Once a technology, standard, or process is adopted and widely used, it becomes locked-in due to increasing returns (e.g., efficiency, familiarity, cost reductions) or because the cost of switching to alternatives becomes prohibitive. As a result, the future evolution of a technology or system can become constrained or shaped by its historical trajectory, even if superior alternatives exist. Classic examples include QWERTY keyboards or VHS over Betamax in the video format wars.

1. **Transformer Architecture Dominance**: Despite emerging models (like alternatives to transformers), the transformer architecture remains dominant due to early success with models like BERT and GPT, locking in massive research, tooling, and infrastructure investments.
  
2. **Reinforcement Learning in Gaming**: Reinforcement learning became entrenched in game AI after successes like AlphaGo, even though alternative AI paradigms might be more efficient or scalable in non-gaming contexts.

3. **Python as the Primary Language for AI Development**: Despite newer languages being faster or more suitable for certain tasks, Python remains the dominant language in AI due to its early adoption, extensive libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch), and developer familiarity.

4. **GPU Hardware for Deep Learning**: Even as new hardware like TPUs and custom AI accelerators emerge, GPUs remain the standard due to a long history of optimization for deep learning workloads and vast existing infrastructure.

5. **Pre-trained Foundation Models**: The early success of pre-trained models (e.g., GPT-3) led to widespread use, shaping the way most AI applications are built now, even though other methods of model training could be more efficient or context-specific.

6. **Centralized AI Data Processing**: Centralized data centers dominated AI development due to scalability and availability, despite the rise of edge computing and federated learning, which might be better suited for privacy and latency-sensitive tasks.

7. **Word Embeddings (Word2Vec/Glove)**: Despite newer approaches like contextual embeddings (e.g., BERT), older static embeddings are still used in many systems due to the simplicity, established pipelines, and inertia from earlier success.

These examples show how early decisions in AI have locked the field into certain methods, frameworks, and infrastructure, even when alternatives might offer future advantages.
