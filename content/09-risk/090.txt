# Risk
## What could possibly go wrong?

* Five concepts you need to understand in order to assess risk of AI and AGI.

What could possibly go wrong? As we progress towards more advanced AI systems, it's crucial to consider the potential risks and challenges. This isn't about fear-mongering, but about being prepared and proactive.

We'll explore risks ranked by impact and immediacy, starting with those closest to us. The most immediate concern is hallucination in language models. It's a feature, not a bug - these systems are stochastic, unpredictable answering machines which will definitely make things up unless we double-check. This poses risks in areas where accuracy is critical.

Bias is another significant issue. All systems are biased because they're built on biased underlying data. Acknowledging, identifying, and working around these biases is a core skill we need to develop.

Moving up the abstraction ladder, we encounter the question of alignment. How do we ensure that AI systems' objectives align with human values and interests? This is a complex problem with no easy solutions.

Then there's the concept of intelligence explosion - the idea that AI could rapidly improve its own capabilities, leading to superintelligence. This scenario poses significant risks as an uncontrollable superintelligent AI could act in ways beyond human understanding and control.

Finally, we need to consider the probability of AI catastrophe, or P(Doom). While it might sound like science fiction, a significant number of AI researchers consider the possibility of existential catastrophe to be real.

This chapter will delve into these risks, exploring their potential impacts and discussing strategies for mitigation. We'll also consider the broader ethical implications of developing increasingly powerful AI systems.

Remember, our AI creations are reflections of our humanity. As we push the boundaries of what's possible, we need to ensure we're doing so responsibly and with a clear understanding of the potential consequences.
