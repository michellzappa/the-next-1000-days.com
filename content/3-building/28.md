# Database Query Design

## Designing data access for comparison, de‑duplication, and validation.

I describe what I want to extract or aggregate, and AI helps shape it into a working query. It’s both a tutor and a second brain for thinking in relational logic, showing how questions translate into data operations.

<div class="field-note">

When results aggregate from multiple models, design the data layer for comparison, de‑duplication, and disagreement handling. Add a validation pass that reconciles conflicts and flags claims for verification.
