# Generative-first Interfaces

## Designing conversations, correction loops, and visible uncertainty.

Designing for a generative collaborator changes the substrate. Instead of fixed forms, you design conversations, affordances for correction, and visible uncertainty. Strategy matters more than craft tips; plan for co‑creation, not one‑shot output.

#### Sidebar — Generative UX (N-074)

Shift the chapter altitude from prompt craft to system design. Plan hand‑offs, model choice, latency expectations, and failure paths. Treat the model as a teammate with strengths and limits.
