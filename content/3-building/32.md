# Architecture Discussion

## Making structure choices explicit: what lives where and why.

When considering how systems connect—what lives on the server, what happens locally—I use AI to talk through alternatives. It helps me balance complexity and stability, making the invisible structure of software more tangible.

#### Merge — Purpose App Prototype (N-086)

A mobile POC for purpose navigation, co‑built step by step, surfaced core loops and risks early. Platform constraints shaped better architecture.

#### Sidebar — Cursor + R1 (N-089)

Reasoning‑first planning in Cursor with R1 improved decomposition and tests. Keep examples brief; show the planning lift, not just code.

#### Merge — Local Inference (N-109)

Porting a flow from cloud to on‑device delivered privacy and lower costs with a working iOS 26 prototype.
