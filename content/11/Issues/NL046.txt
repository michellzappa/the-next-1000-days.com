Happy Monday and welcome to your weekly guide to our (inevitable) transition toward AGI.

I have been thinking a lot about working and hiring in a context where autonomous systems are already capable of replacing so many of our tasks. I would never have considered commissioning an artist weekly to create the newsletter cover image, but thanks to Dall-E and a few of my minutes, each edition can easily be illustrated with an original piece. While the metaphor does not yet extend to all other areas of work, I sense the amount of different capabilities that we are able to up-skill ourselves in, is only going to increase. The only limitation is our time and desire to learn and apply new skills.

In some circles people are betting on when weâ€™ll see the first single-person, AI-augmented company worth $1B. With a handful of employees, MidJourney is possibly the closest match so far, but we can certain that thousands to millions of people are out there pushing the boundary of how much of a force-multiplier the right AI can become. I suspect such companies will be as common as unicorns by the end of the decade.
This weekâ€™s issue features a collection of lectures and observations from around the web. If this selection isnâ€™t enough to satiate your curiosity, consider ðŸ’¬ joining our new WhatsApp group where these and many other links were discussed.
