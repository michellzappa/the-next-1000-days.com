Happy Monday and welcome to another edition of Artificial Insights. Thanks to everyone who shared suggested names and links to thinkers and researchers I should follow. In such a broad and fast-moving field as artificial intelligence, it is a constant challenge to even decide who to read and what to focus on. In publishing this newsletter I hope to help you navigate and learn from some of the voices shaping our (inevitable) future of more and different kinds of intelligence.

This week features a few short talks and articles exploring the implications and possible consequences of the explosion in intelligence we are experiencing. I have a strong suspicion that we will learn a lot more about non-human intelligences in the near future – there are probably many more kinds of intelligence out there than our anthropocentric worldview have us consider. It would be arrogant and short-sighted to imagine our current selves at the peak of intellectual evolution – and it arguably wise to learn about possible kinds of intelligence lurking around the corner.
