Happy Monday and welcome to your weekly edition of artificial insights.
Like so many others, this was an active week in the AI news cycle. In contrast, I have tried to remain focused on concentrated efforts. There is finally a first recording of the lecture which consolidates what I think about where we are heading, with a dose of practical applications for an advanced but not necessarily expert audience. Presented at a fast pace and without exercises, it runs about 90 min. I’m not even sure a “class” is the best way to convey some of these ideas, but I’ll have a lot more to show in coming weeks.
This week’s newsletter edition is packed to the brim with links to insightful articles, interviews and tech demos to help you make sense of what’s happening in the field. If you have something to share, please to so in our WhatsApp group, which is by far my favorite place on the internet to talk about and learn what is going on.
Finally, we have made stickers and other goodies for all newsletter readers who want them. If you’d like some merch in your mailbox, please share your postal address using this form.
Until next week,MZ
