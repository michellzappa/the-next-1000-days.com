066


Sometimes it starts feeling repetitive for me to try covering ongoing developments in a way that is novel on a recurring schedule.

There are only so many observations to be made, only so many insights to describe before the news cycle feels more like a loop than a progression.

This week is no exception. Below you will find a selection of interviews, articles and thought pieces which all share the general perception that we are experiencing an unprecedented amount of change around this technology, that it is far from a panacea, and that it might cause more harm than good. Yet, change will keep accelerating and the amount of resources poured into the field will only go up.

My take is as always: use whichever technologies are available as much as possible, and approach them with the mindset that they will keep improving. There are infinite possibilities for how to apply and integrate AI into more-or-less all aspects of our lives, and nobody has it all figured out. Capabilities will keep improving while costs will keep going down, and gains will be had by those who sense opportunities where others donâ€™t.
I wish you a great week ahead full of actual insight.
