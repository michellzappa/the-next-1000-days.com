Happy Monday and welcome to another edition of Artificial Insights, where we explore as many different perspectives about the emerging field of AI as possible.


As 2023 starts drawing to a close we may ask ourselves what to expect from the year ahead. This has been a year of (dare I say) unprecedented change when it comes to practical applications of machine learning, and 2024 will be even more so.

I am sure you are also experiencing AI fatigue. The news can be overwhelming, and the conversations about its manifold implications can feel draining. I am not here to fan the flames. Rather I think we should spend more time experimenting with it. The only race worth mentioning is the one towards greater, better use of these tools. Depending on your use, they can be borderline magical.

There is no doubt whether you are going to see more AI in the months and years ahead - I think thatâ€™s a certainty. The only question worth asking is what role you want to play in this transition.
