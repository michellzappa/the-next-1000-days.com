Greetings Earthlings! This week’s newsletter features our usual assortment of links and takeaways around what has caught my attention in the rapidly developing space of AI and collective intelligence. 
When I started writing this newsletter a couple of months ago I suspected there would not be enough noteworthy content to produce a weekly overview, but it turns out the opposite has been true. Keeping the selection to only five weekly links has been increasingly challenging, and not a week goes by without me going through an overwhelming amount of articles, interviews and lectures from amazing thinkers shaping the field.
As always – if this resonates with you, please reach out with feedback or likes. Your input means the world to me and I’m immensely grateful to have you as a reader.
