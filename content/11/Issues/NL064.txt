Like so many of us, I have been exploring different approaches for both learning and applying cutting-edge AI practices in all aspects of my life. One example is a Masterclass that Iâ€™ve been tinkering with a while, containing what I think are foundational skills to understand the current moment in time and probable future trajectories. 

The hardest thing about designing learning material for such a broad & fast-moving field is living up to the promise of delivering the right level of insight to the right audience (at the right time). Everyone has a different level of familiarity, interest and needs when it comes to learning about AI, so striking that balance seems key.

To help me frame the question better, I use the slide below in the presentation. The ideal audience has some degree of technical knowledge as well as strategic understanding about the field, and ideally some skin in the game as well. People who are experimenting and stand to gain something from succeeding with these skills.

If this is you, perfect. We soon launching and scaling up this learning material. You will obviously be the first to find out when the Masterclass starts going live later this year.
