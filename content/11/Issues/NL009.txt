Welcome to Artificial Insights – your weekly review of links to articles, interviews and memes helping you understand our transition towards more kinds of intelligence.

Two months into publication, the opening rates and clickthroughs on Substack have been surprisingly consistent: a whopping 55% view each edition, of which circa 10% end up clicking on a link – which tells me 90% of you are here for the commentary (!).

This week’s edition features the best of what has populated by YouTube and Twitter recommendation algorithms lately. I am spending all free time learning about as many perspectives as possible when it comes to our transition towards AGI, and this newsletter attempts to highlight and translate the most important ideas and voices as they come across my feeds.

If this resonates, consider sharing this week’s edition with friends & enemies on your socials to help us grow and reach more likeminded people looking to learn. AI will change everything – it already is – so let’s make sure the right voices are part of the conversation.

This week’s edition features a handful of new subheaders and format adjustments. Send feedback and memes my way!
