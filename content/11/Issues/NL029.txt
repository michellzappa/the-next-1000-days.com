What do you make of the chaos playing out at OpenAI in the past 72 hours? 

Anyone following the drama is left with an interminable list of questions of how the hottest company in tech can be subject to such volatility.  For those who haven’t been glued to Twitter over the weekend, Sam Altman the CEO of OpenAI was suddenly fired due to an apparent disagreement with the nonprofit board overseeing the company. After a couple of attepts at consolidating the different parties’ interest over the weekend, Satya Nadella of Microsoft intervened and has apparently offered to hire most of the OpenAI team into a new company led by Altman.

This newsletter avoids commenting on the news as I prefer spending time covering the big-picture thinking shaping the arc of development instead. OpenAI is an exceptional company with an outsized effect on the industry. 

Whether they were right in accelerating their approach for getting the technology into the hands of users or whether they should exercise caution is a discussion for another time. There is little point in speculating how the reorganization will unfold, and I am certain this weekend will be considered a watershed moment moving forward, regardless of what happens next.

To make sense of the individuals involved, I have selected interviews and presentations with each of the five key players, which might help you understand their various incentives and worldviews moving forward.

I started this newsletter 29 weeks ago with the intent of tracking our (inevitable) transition toward AGI. According to how you read the Twitter tea leaves, the boiling point between the OpenAI board and leadership were about the misaligned risks and incentives around the impending development of something that looks a lot like AGI. Exciting times!
