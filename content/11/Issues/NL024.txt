Welcome to another week of Artificial Insights, where we try to navigate and make sense of our inevitable transition toward AGI. The present is all-consuming and leaves little space for thinking about the big picture of possible futures. I firmly believe that the development happening around automation and augmentation are a society-changing process which will ultimately reorient all existing institutions and processes. Unlike recent hype cycles, development in human-machine interactions is the first general-purpose technology since the internet and it fundamentally transforms the expectations and capabilities of every individual and organization which takes it seriously. Understanding how to use it is a bare minimum and anticipating the implications after it seems like the only sensible thing to spend time on considering its potential.
