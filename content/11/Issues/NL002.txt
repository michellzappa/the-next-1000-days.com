Many of you asked me whether this newsletter is â€“Â you guessed it â€“Â written by AI.

The boring answer is Iâ€™m still pecking out every letter on a computer keyboard, and very much finding the voice and intent of this newsletter by (irreducibly) writing it. I am obviously exploring approaches for creating an AI research copilot, and am using the newsletter as an opportunity to reflect on what automation does best, and where I should stay in the picture.

This weekâ€™s edition contains video clips and interviews from what I hope is a representative selection of voices about the transition toward AGI. The amount of content being generated in this space is staggering, so keeping the issues short and insightful feels like a top priority. 

Thanks to all new subscribers â€“ and apologies for the formatting errors last week â€“ Substack noob here. That being said, Iâ€™m thrilled with how many people are actually interested in AGI! There are so many good daily AI newsletters to follow, so I hope Artificial Insights will help more people develop a bigger-picture understanding of the field. Institutions like Oxfordâ€™s Future Humanity Institute and forums like LessWrong are great places to go deeper into the implications of and pathways to AGI. This newsletter is about to bridging the knowledge gap, and help preserve a human perspective on our inevitable technological future. Thanks for reading! ðŸ––
