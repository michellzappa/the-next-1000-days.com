Nothing makes me appreciate the passing of time as much as routines. The weekly commitment of sharing what I have learned about AI and developing an ongoing and public opinion about the state of development is a great reminder of how few days there actually are between one Monday and the following.

This week’s edition includes a handful of links to nuggets that will help you understand the quickly developing area of machine intelligence, from as many diverse perspectives as possible.

Last week I had the privilege of meeting a close friend and collaborator in Lisbon – our work together revolves around education and training – and it’s increasingly apparent how all forward-looking conversations today revolve around the inevitable development of AI. Maybe I am biased, but it is increasingly difficult to imagine a world where we define intelligence as something that happens only within yourself – rather it should be a measure of our ability to collaborate and grow with as many other intelligences as possible. We owe this to future generations.
