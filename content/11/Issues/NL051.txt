After a flurry of announcements and releases in the past few months, last week felt positively quiet in the world of AI news. This in all likelihood means we’re about to see another wave of breakthrough news soon, maybe even the much-rumored and maybe openly tested GPT 4.5 from OpenAI. There is no question whether new models are on the horizon, but rather which additional chunks of the value chain that OpenAI (and others) are trying to absorb with AI next. After recently strengthening their RAG offers, my bet is that OpenAI is next moving into search, real-time knowledge, and eventually non-digital and real world applications like customer service and robotics.

Meanwhile, I have been working on the “presentation I’d like to see”, when it comes to explaining the cutting edge of AI applications and some of their long term implications. Having talked about centaurs (hybrid intelligence approaches) the better part of the past decade, I’m long overdue to put together a fresh deck for readers like yourself: people with a diverse professional background who strongly care about where AI is headed. I’ll soon announce a community session around presenting the session and collecting feedback, but if you have questions or ideas for what such a presentation needs to include, please DM me.
