Happy Monday and welcome to another edition of Artificial Insights – brought to you mostly by the talking heads of Davos.

This week’s edition offers the usual array of high-level insight of where the large players in AI talk about moving. To me, the AI industry appears fairly transparent and, dare I say, well intentioned. Having followed most leaders’ public disclosures and interviews in the past few years, it seems to me their actual business moves rarely deviate from stated goals. I am sure there is misdirection and and PR spin, as in all highly competitive industries, but have noticed that simply listening to how these individuals describe their work is incredibly instructive when it comes to ascertaining likely future directions.

On a different note: how do you learn best practices for ChatGPT?
I am considering creating a shared Team account for a small number of high-impact explorers in this space. I am using ChatGPT at least a dozen times every day and am using the experience primarily as a means of discovering how limited my knowledge of everything I thought was unimportant actually is. In other words, no question is too simple for ChatGPT, and the level of depth you can actually achieve if you know which questions to ask has been absolutely remarkable for me. I am thinking of creating a paid Team account with a handful of readers willing to pay a premium for a shared workspace plus a secure chat environment. Message me if this is something you are interested in exploring and when you would like to get started?

Thanks to everyone who sends me links between issues. I sometimes manage to keep track and credit you, but often lapse. Know that every issue is supported by readers like you.
