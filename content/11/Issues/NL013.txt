Happy last day of July and welcome to Artificial Insights.

In the last few weeks I have been thinking about the implications of being surrounded by multiple types of intelligence. In all likelihood, we as a species will have to contend with losing the top spot in the evolutionary food chain. Whether we ever deserved (or occupied) that spot is arguable, but the advent and discovery of surprising new types of intelligence cohabiting with us should invite the question of what it even means to be a species of great intellect.
If we were to identify or even create species for whom we are nothing but local fauna, what would that entail? Would that force a collective reconsideration of priorities and values, or would we double down on our archaic constructs of scarcity and resource hoarding? Would it invite us to strengthen our collective bonds and promote mutual advancement? Which of these attitudes, if any, would a superior intelligence expect of us?
