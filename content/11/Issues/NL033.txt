Happy Monday and welcome to a brief edition of Artificial Insights. The year is coming to an end, and many feel overwhelmed.

After 33 editions, or circa 150 commented links, my article backlog contains nearly 200 additional links which caught my attention but which haven’t made their way into the newsletter yet. 

I have no idea which approach is ideal when it comes to learning about a new area of knowledge - but I am happy to say the number of subscribers and opening rate for this very newsletter has proven successful. We recently crossed the 1.000 reader mark on LinkedIn and the Substack edition regularly receives 45-50% opening rates, which means Artificial Insights is resonating. 

This week’s edition features a couple of lectures from TEDxAI in San Francisco and a handful of articles about current developments. My plan for the holidays is to go through some of the backlog and keep publishing every Monday. I hope to see you around!
