Welcome to another week of Artificial Insights where we try making sense of the tools shaping the future of… everything? Last week’s edition seems to have struck a nerve with many readers, some of which reached out to comment on it. I’m a firm believer that the advent of AI (whether we call it AGI or ASI or simply forget calling it anything) is simply not going away. We can somewhat opt out the use of these tools on a personal level, but collectively our transition into this reality is a like a ratchet – with every new step of technological capacity, our expectations are squeezed towards greater reliance on the tool. There is no natural reversal of this course. We will keep colliding towards increased dependence on AI. Only those who prepare by integrating AI tools into their workflows today in order to fundamentally rethink their work moving forward are likely to succeed.
In other words, it is not enough to automate your existing work in order to save time. Rather, you should rethink the very role and purpose of your efforts, from the perspective of a future where AI performs some or maybe most of the value you provide as a professional to the market. What is left for you to do?
