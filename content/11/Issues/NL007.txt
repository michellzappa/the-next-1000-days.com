I am left with the impression that AI is irreparably embedded into all industries and areas of interest & that whatever happens next needs be considered with regards to AI and not despite of it. This moment invites us to explore more kinds of reality and all types of intelligence. If the limits of our language are the limits of our world, then maybe we should consider more kinds of languages to broaden our horizons.
