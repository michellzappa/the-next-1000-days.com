Happy Monday and welcome to your weekly sense-making experience around AI.

Today marks the halfway point of the year and might serve as a reminder that only transformation is certain. Having spent the weekend moving house here in Amsterdam, I have very little in terms of personal commentary this week â€“ only that 1) forcefully stepping away from screens can be a relief 2) good housing in a dense city is a tremendous privilege and 3) extending my abilities with AI has become second nature and it would feel like a cognitive downgrade losing access to it.
Trivial things like finding garbage zoning information, gardening basics or organization tips can be gleaned through LLMs, which of course was always possible with search engines, but now offers approach which adapts information to your needs. I literally cannot imagine this going away.

If this newsletter tickles your fancy, consider joining our WhatsApp group, which has by far become my favorite spot on the internet to follow & discuss AI.

Until next week,MZ
