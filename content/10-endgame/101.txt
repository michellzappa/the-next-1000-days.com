# Our robots, our selves.

I've picked a couple of images of robots from sci-fi simply as a reminder of how we perceive these AIs through our manifestations, our output, and our creative work. There's no specific observation about these images; it's just a reminder that we make the systems in our own image. We project capabilities upon every technology and expect it to act, work, and be like us. But of course, it isn't. It's going to be biased and unpredictable in ways that we have to at least try to plan around. If it's emergent and unpredictable, then so be it, but we have to set the right intentions and put in the right work to ensure it ends up somewhere favorable for most, if not all.
