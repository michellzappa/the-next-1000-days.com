# Leverage points

Systemic perspective what are the effective points that we should be working on

From a **systems thinking** perspective, identifying **leverage points** is critical for directing the development of AGI responsibly and mitigating its potential risks. Leverage points are places in complex systems where a small shift can produce significant changes. Based on this framework, here are the most impactful leverage points we should focus on first:

### 1. **Paradigm Shift (Mindset and Purpose)**
   - **Leverage Point**: Changing the underlying mindset about what AGI is for and why we are developing it.
   - **Action**: Shift global narratives about AGI from “profit and control” to “human and ecological flourishing.” We need a consensus that AGI must serve long-term human values (equality, sustainability, collective well-being) rather than short-term corporate or military interests.
   - **Why It Matters**: If the purpose of AGI is defined purely by profit or power, the resulting systems will reflect and reinforce these values. By embedding AGI’s development in ethical and sustainable paradigms, we set its trajectory early.

### 2. **Power Distribution (Who Controls AGI)**
   - **Leverage Point**: Democratizing the ownership and control of AGI systems.
   - **Action**: Create mechanisms to decentralize the development and deployment of AGI, ensuring no single entity (government, corporation, or nation) holds disproportionate power. This could involve public-private partnerships, open-source models, or global regulatory bodies.
   - **Why It Matters**: Centralized control over AGI would exacerbate inequality and create unprecedented power imbalances. Shifting toward distributed control helps mitigate this risk and promotes a fairer distribution of benefits.

### 3. **Governance and Regulation (Feedback Loops)**
   - **Leverage Point**: Designing effective regulatory feedback loops to govern AGI’s development.
   - **Action**: Establish adaptive, global governance frameworks that can quickly respond to AGI’s exponential growth and its emergent behaviors. This includes agile regulatory systems capable of overseeing and auditing AGI’s algorithms, decisions, and impacts in real-time.
   - **Why It Matters**: A key systems principle is ensuring robust feedback loops to maintain system health. Without governance that can “learn” and adapt, the AGI system will evolve without constraint, leading to unpredictable outcomes.

### 4. **Information Flows (Transparency and Accountability)**
   - **Leverage Point**: Increasing transparency in AGI systems and decision-making processes.
   - **Action**: Mandate transparent reporting on AGI’s development, capabilities, and outcomes, and create public oversight institutions to hold developers accountable. Open-source standards, peer review, and public audit mechanisms should be prioritized.
   - **Why It Matters**: In any complex system, information flow is crucial. If AGI development is opaque, society will have little control over its impact. Transparency ensures that negative consequences can be identified and addressed early.

### 5. **Changing the Rules (Incentive Structures)**
   - **Leverage Point**: Redefining the rules and incentive structures driving AGI research and development.
   - **Action**: Reform financial and research incentives to prioritize AGI applications that enhance collective well-being, sustainability, and equity over narrow profit motives. Redirect investment toward AGI for solving global challenges (e.g., climate change, health, education).
   - **Why It Matters**: Incentive structures deeply shape behavior in complex systems. Currently, AGI development is incentivized by competitive market forces and geopolitical power dynamics. Shifting these incentives toward human and ecological benefit can redirect AGI’s trajectory.

### 6. **Self-Regulation (Recursive Feedback)**
   - **Leverage Point**: Embedding ethical self-regulation mechanisms into AGI systems.
   - **Action**: Build AGI systems that have embedded feedback loops for ethical reasoning, safety checks, and value alignment, ensuring that they constantly monitor and adjust their own behavior in line with human values.
   - **Why It Matters**: Since AGI systems will evolve through recursive self-improvement, building ethical self-regulation into these systems from the outset ensures that they remain aligned with human values, even as they become more autonomous.

### 7. **Human Capacity Building (Education and Adaptation)**
   - **Leverage Point**: Enhancing societal capacity to understand and adapt to AGI.
   - **Action**: Reform global education systems to focus on adaptability, ethical reasoning, systems thinking, and AI literacy. We must prepare future generations to coexist and work alongside AGI in meaningful ways, emphasizing creativity, critical thinking, and interdisciplinary approaches.
   - **Why It Matters**: If humans cannot adapt to the changes AGI brings, society will face widespread dislocation. Strengthening human capacity through education and resilience training creates a society capable of managing AGI’s risks and opportunities.

### 8. **Initial Conditions (Early Design Decisions)**
   - **Leverage Point**: Setting the right constraints, goals, and architectures for AGI in its early stages of development.
   - **Action**: Focus on designing AGI with built-in ethical frameworks, constraints, and “fail-safes” from the start. Decisions made now about AGI’s architecture and goals will have long-term consequences, so it’s crucial to set the right initial conditions to prevent runaway systems.
   - **Why It Matters**: Complex systems often follow paths determined by their early design choices. Once AGI systems are fully autonomous, it will be difficult to reverse or constrain them. Early design decisions are therefore crucial leverage points.

### 9. **Cultural Narratives (Beliefs and Values)**
   - **Leverage Point**: Shaping the cultural narratives and values around AGI.
   - **Action**: Use media, education, and public discourse to create a collective understanding of AGI’s potential and risks. Shift the narrative from AGI as a tool for profit or dominance to AGI as a collaborative partner for humanity’s long-term survival and flourishing.
   - **Why It Matters**: Cultural beliefs and values act as leverage points in systems because they shape behavior and expectations. By framing AGI as a tool for collective progress rather than individual gain, we can influence the direction of its development.

### 10. **Leverage Networks (Ecosystem Thinking)**
   - **Leverage Point**: Viewing AGI development as part of a larger socio-technical ecosystem.
   - **Action**: Foster global, interdisciplinary networks of collaboration that connect technologists, ethicists, policymakers, and diverse stakeholders in AGI’s development. AGI is not just a technical challenge; it is a societal transformation requiring input from multiple fields.
   - **Why It Matters**: Systems are interconnected, and changes in one part of the system often ripple out to affect others. By encouraging cross-disciplinary networks and a holistic approach, we ensure that AGI development considers its broader impacts on society and the environment.

### 11. **Paradigm of Cooperation vs. Competition**
   - **Leverage Point**: Shifting the development of AGI from a competitive, zero-sum race to a cooperative global effort.
   - **Action**: Foster international collaboration and create frameworks for knowledge-sharing to ensure that AGI is developed for the common good, avoiding dangerous arms-race dynamics.
   - **Why It Matters**: Competitive dynamics in technology development often result in cutting corners, prioritizing speed over safety. A cooperative approach allows for more thoughtful, ethical development.
