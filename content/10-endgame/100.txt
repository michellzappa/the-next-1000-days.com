You must learn to proceed without certainty. Where do we go from here? What happens if we decide not to act? Who is responsible for the outcome?

We're at a pivotal moment in technological history. AI is not just another tool - it's a transformative force that's reshaping every industry, every sector, every aspect of our lives. The endgame isn't clear, but the direction is.

Every company is becoming an AI company, whether they realize it or not. All software will eventually include AI capabilities. We're seeing a global AI arms race, with nations and corporations vying for supremacy in this field. The implications are profound and far-reaching.

So what can we do? Three key actions: Join the conversation - AI is an open field with plenty of space for more voices. Find others - connect with those who share your interests and concerns. Start a project - pick a subject that interests you and dive in, using AI to learn about AI.

As we navigate this uncertain future, we need to ask ourselves some crucial questions: Which data is available to us? What are we looking to automate, and why? How can we augment our abilities with AI?

Looking ahead, we can expect to see more proactive agents, new computing paradigms, and a continued capability explosion. But the details of how this will unfold remain unclear.

This chapter will explore potential future scenarios, discuss strategies for adapting to an AI-driven world, and consider our collective responsibility in shaping the outcome. We'll also reflect on the broader philosophical implications of creating new forms of intelligence.

Remember, the future isn't predetermined. Our actions today will shape the AI landscape of tomorrow. It's up to us to ensure that this powerful technology is developed and used in ways that benefit humanity as a whole.


Regulatory landscape: An overview of current and upcoming AI regulations in different regions (e.g., EU AI Act, China's AI regulations) and how they might shape the future of AI development and deployment.

Celebrating fifty newsletter editions, I took the opportunity to review the 250+ links that have been shared in the past year, in order to retroactively identify the content which I think retains the most value today. Having absorbed countless hours of interviews, lectures and research papers, some of these links have only become more important over time – especially those outlining shape of AGI and our changing relationship to work. They are featured below.

Reflecting on the experience of covering such a fast-moving field closely, I am more determined than ever to keep this publication going. Many of you have followed me since the very first issue, and others are just finding out about our ways of seeing AI. What we all share is a desire to understand what is going on, and how it will affect us and those around us.

Future issues will try taking on a more practical approach to working with AI. We will absolutely keep featuring high-level insights from the industry, but I want to start bringing as many of these ideas into practice as possible. Things like better prompting, clearer understanding of the kinds of AI we are talking about (not everything is generative), and so on.
My biggest ask right now is: find the others. Share the publication (or its content) with those around you capable of doing something with this information, and help me reach more AI experts who care.
