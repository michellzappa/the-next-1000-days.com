How do you make space to wrap your mind around the hyperobject that is AI?

What is a sufficient amount of time, energy or money invested in making sense of it?

Reading this newsletter is a small but recurring habit that helps you stay informed. Similarly, writing these weekly insights has been one of my best tools for understanding the field.

Arguably, the best way to develop a deeper understanding of these tools is by scoping and executing personal AI-oriented projects.
Whether you’re just starting with Claude or ChatGPT or are fully experienced with embedded intelligences, the most reliable way to upskill is by building something with them.

Personally, not a week goes by without attempting to build something using current AI tools. Whether it’s creating a vocabulary of AI-related terms or developing a Tarot experience with AI, I always ground new responsibilities around AI’s capabilities.
