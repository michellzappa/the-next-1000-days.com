Happy Monday and greetings from a hyperactive Dubai. I am here this week with a dream team of collaborators to participate in a panel about generative AI and the future of cities at COP28. The session is open, and if you happen to be around, we would love to receive you at the Terra Pavilion on Wednesday at 3pm. Weâ€™ll be hosting a quick interactive AI co-creation exercise for participants and engage in conversation about the role of machine learning in shaping the future of urban innovation with high profile guests. Participants will explore how their personal sense of purpose overlaps with possible future job opportunities. Would love to see you there!
