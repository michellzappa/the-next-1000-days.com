Happy Monday and welcome to Artificial Insights, your weekly guide to the metaverse that matters: an inevitable future commingled with intelligences far greater than our own. To me, it is deeply fascinating to watch this explosion unfold in real time. Science fiction, scientists and businesses have presented visions of potential AI for decades, and in the past few years the shift from promise to delivery happened quickly. Bordering on cliché, the past 12 months have seen more staggering change happen than maybe the last 12 years, and it goes without saying this will keep accelerating.

How do we navigate an age of unprecedented change? The innovation tales of disruption only make sense in a bounded, finite game. AGI is different. While all technologies are force-multipliers, the factor of change delivered by AI tools today is already changing personal practices everywhere. Copywriters, illustrators and so many other talents have had their markets decimated overnight, and it seems the only way forward is by embracing these solutions and absorbing them into our lives.

To me, that boils down to spending as much time as possible using these tools simply so I know what is possible and where my own limitations are hindering growth. Last week that meant building another web app from scratch using ChatGPT. The “Envisioning Purpose” exercise has been applied over 100 times, and we felt it was time to build a standalone version in our Envisioning Lab. The web app is fully functional and we’re offering a free hands-on demo this Wednesday at 18 CET for those who are interested.
