While the southern hemisphere braces for winter, in the north it seems everyone is (or wish they were) on summer break. This weekâ€™s edition keeps it brief and inspiring, featuring insights and links to help shape your thinking among the growing fields of artificial intelligence.

Every week I spend as much time as possible watching and reading the voices of those creating and describing these fields like founders, researchers and journalists. I am intentionally inclusive in where I scope these news and updates, and yet feel the walls of embedded biases closing in when week after week the selection of names comes up predominantly white and male. You can help diversify this publication further by sharing links to thinkers we should all be paying attention to. I am deliberately breaking out of the filter bubble wherever possible and need your help to keep pushing against the edges.
