This week I find myself in beautiful Vienna for what was supposed to be a conference trip to talk about centaurs and augmented intelligence – and which turned into an excellent opportunity to spend time with collaborators and clients.

A few days ago I polled our WhatsApp community for interest in either presenting at or simply joining a remote newsletter meetup. The turnout was reassuringly positive which means we’ve started organizing something where community members can showcase what they have been working on and interact with & receive feedback from fellow members. We have half dozen potential speakers already but I want to make sure all readers are equally invited – so if you would like to briefly present your AI-related work to fellow thinkers sometime next month, please either reply to this message and/or join us in the community. Presentations will be as short as possible, with emphasis on group interaction, so don’t hold back if you don’t feel ready to present yet.

In fact, I can’t overstate how delightful it has been to host an ongoing conversation with 150 of my closest friends on WhatsApp – all bringing their personal perspective to the ongoing evolution of AI. If you don’t mind a high-volume & high-signal group, you should absolutely join.

On a different note, last week I sat down with friend Ina Catrinescu for a long conversation about … everything that fascinates me. We obviously talked about AI and possible futures but we also went down philosophical rabbit holes and intellectual journeys, exploring the nature of consciousness, the ethics of technological advancements, and the intersection of science and spirituality and much more. Check it out!
Until next week,MZ
