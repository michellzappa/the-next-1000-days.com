Happy Monday and welcome to Artificial Insights, your weekly guide to artificial intelligence. The best part of writing this newsletter to me is normalizing the vast amount of time spent on learning about this particular subset of technologies and their potential long term implication. The promise of AI has hung over us for decades, and while most professional futurists would agree that it was likely to take off within our lifetimes, the actual speed at which it is taking off is remarkable.

The 32 editions since launching Artificial Insights have given me space to experiment with different approaches for publishing this weekly. Staying on top of the news and selecting pieces to help you visualize of the near future is infinitely rewarding. One of my personal highlights has been interviewing friends and fellow futurists about their personal take on some of the issues here present, such as this one with Lydia Caldana or Ricardo Cappra. While I’m still waiting to hear back from some invited collaborators, I want to make sure to keep the pipeline full for next year. If you or someone you know is into AI futures, shoot me a message with your public thoughts or research, and I’ll make sure to prepare a couple of questions for you. 

Another highlight of mine has been around exploring techniques for utilizing AI tools across my entire workflow. We’ve spoken about this on occasion in past issues, but my intent for next year is to further document and present best practices and approaches for working with AI. If this is something you’ve either done or want to learn more about, please also reach out.
