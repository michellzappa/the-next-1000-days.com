Last night I trained a CustomGPT on ~all~ my public writing. Having spent the holidays organizing two decades of blog posts I figured this half-megabyte of content should be a formidable starting point for creating a personal writing assistant.
Most of us have probably realized how limited and generic generative writing can sound without deliberate effort, and I suspected that preparing curated personal training data could significantly help on the self-automation front.
The first output (which isn’t this introduction) came out surprisingly decent. I submitted a draft article with feedback commentary, and asked GPT to rewrite it in my style. The piece ended up needing a new intro and light editing, but was 90% there within a minute. The subject matter was “known” by the GPT because it covered topics I have written about previously, but I was surprised at how good the response came out with such little effort. You evidently need to direct the production even after training to generate quality results. I’ll explore other sources of personal writing to supplement the data and better capture my tone and ideas. 
This week’s issue features a fanciful selection of interviews and articles to help you make  sense of the evolving landscape of GenAI and our inevitable progress towards AGI. While “general intelligence” means different things to different groups, it feels increasingly certain that the development of our tools and economies are moving in that general direction, and that staying informed to be the only sensible strategy.
A couple of readers showed interest in participating in a shared ChatGPT Teams account, but not nearly enough to justify launching a group just yet. I’m collecting use cases and building custom apps left & right and will keep sharing them with you here in future issues. LMK what resonates.
