I recently moved in to an apartment with a back yard, and one of the favorite things I've done with the space has been setting up a bird feeder. The first month after placing the peanut & seed mix for our hungry flying friends was slow and we noticed no visitors. Fast forward a few weeks and I am now topping up the feeder daily for a bunch of city birds to feast, giving me something animate and colorful to stare away from the monitor throughout the day.

From the birds' perspective, it's an easy win, and word spreads quickly among the feathered when good food is to be found.

Symbiosis. There are many ways to coexist. We interact with countless species through indirect experience. We are vastly more intelligent than most of these and have exploited that difference to our collective advantage throughout history. We have contained nature and made it obey our will. This feels obvious, yet difficult to see.

I am not suggesting future superintelligences will lure us in with free food for their delight.

I have no reason to believe they will be act with benevolence.

Why would they? 

Everywhere we find a jump in intelligence there is exploitation. Benign use is possible but not expected. Superintelligence is not a guarantee, instead we might experience a long plateau where the next generations of AI tapers off around human-level expertise. Instead of surpassing us, they would complement us. 

The alternative, where superintelligence takes off, is almost impossible to anticipate. If artificial *general* intelligence is our capacity to replace human-level at a large scale, then we don't need superintelligence. If on the other hand we see the state of the art surpass our collective abilities, then we can only guess what happens on the other side.

#### Meet fellow subscribers

Two weeks from now, on [Monday October 21 we will be hosting our first virtual subscriber meetup](https://lu.ma/6cftp2gk). Our purpose together: meeting fellow readers, giving optional feedback on the masterclass I've been working on, and share our individual perspectives and concerns about AGI and ASI.

This week in Amsterdam, on [Thursday October 10 we will be hosting our first in-person subscriber meetup](https://lu.ma/n3d8kz7h). We'll meet at Zoku after work for a drink and do a quick exercise about AGI and ASI. The first drink is on us!

# Feeling the AGI (2h30m)
Interview by Lex Fridman with the Cursor founding team. Deeply insightful if you are a software developer (before or after LLMs). The future of software is in the hands of centaurs. The founders' have a unique perspective of the development ecosystem and how AI will keep empowering more people to build.
