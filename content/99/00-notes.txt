- how do we create an inclusive future which considers everyone?
- agi:
	- agency
	- planning
	- observations of the world
		- model needs to understand the world
- incentives
	- what are the objectives of the institutions that control AI → that's what the future will look like.
- takeover scenarios
	- how much power did we voluntarily transfer to AI?
	- what did we give them vs. what did they take?
	- will we hand over our systems to AI?
- is your AI curious?
	- how does it learn and find things out
- technical intro
	- Epoch

	- Different architectures depending on purpose and functions
		- CNNs - images and objects
		- RNNs - forecasting time series and predicting stock markets
		- Transformer Architecture 
			- used by LLMs like chatgpt and Llama.
- how we learn and absorb information - similar to training data. what is creativity even?
- talking to your documents
- performance degradation
- This is not a technical primer. Instead i assume you know how AI works.
- Endgame: Scenario BR
- Endgame: Scenario EU
- How to keep legislation and development in lockstep 
	- AI law should be based on science, not science fiction
- Premise: we need more technical and strategic skills to deal with AGI
- Generational shift inevitable → genz is technically underskilled from growing up with tablets
- AI needs experience to experience the world to understand the world
- Disembodied intelligence
- How do you agree to AI how do you talk to it what do you do when it's writing reflect on it what does it mean about how we treat our machines our intelligence
- Implications for school and work and other locations

# Kinds of Intelligence Chart
A commonly understood framework for categorizing human intelligence is Howard Gardner’s Theory of Multiple Intelligences. It suggests that humans possess different kinds of intelligences, often classified into the following categories:
	1.	Linguistic Intelligence – sensitivity to spoken and written language.
	2.	Logical-Mathematical Intelligence – ability to analyze problems logically and handle mathematical operations.
	3.	Spatial Intelligence – capacity to think in images and visualize accurately.
	4.	Musical Intelligence – skill in performance, composition, and appreciation of musical patterns.
	5.	Bodily-Kinesthetic Intelligence – ability to control physical movement and handle objects skillfully.
	6.	Interpersonal Intelligence – capacity to understand and interact effectively with others.
	7.	Intrapersonal Intelligence – understanding of oneself and one’s thoughts and feelings.
	8.	Naturalistic Intelligence – ability to recognize and categorize natural elements like plants, animals, and environmental features.
	9.	(Existential Intelligence – sensitivity and capacity to tackle deep questions about human existence.)
