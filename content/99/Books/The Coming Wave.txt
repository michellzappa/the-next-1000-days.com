The Coming Wave
Mustafa Suleyman

The various technologies I’m speaking of share four key features that explain why this isn’t business as usual: they are inherently general and therefore omni-use, they hyper-evolve, they have asymmetric impacts, and, in some respects, they are increasingly autonomous.

Almost every foundational technology ever invented, from pickaxes to plows, pottery to photography, phones to planes, and everything in between, follows a single, seemingly immutable law: it gets cheaper and easier to use, and ultimately it proliferates, far and wide.

This is the core dilemma: that, sooner or later, a powerful generation of technology leads humanity toward either catastrophic or dystopian outcomes. I believe this is the great meta-problem of the twenty-first century.

The coming wave is defined by two core technologies: artificial intelligence (AI) and synthetic biology.

AI has been climbing the ladder of cognitive abilities for decades, and it now looks set to reach human-level performance across a very wide range of tasks within the next three years.

Proliferation is catalyzed by two forces: demand and the resulting cost decreases, each of which drives technology to become even better and cheaper.

They finished with an alarming thought: a single person today likely “has the capacity to kill a billion people.” All it takes is motivation.

Technology’s unavoidable challenge is that its makers quickly lose control over the path their inventions take once introduced to the world.

We are not just the creators of our tools. We are, down to the biological, the anatomical level, a product of them.

Containment is not, on the face of it, possible. And yet for all our sakes, containment must be possible.
