it's sometimes said that the last invention Humanity will ever invent is artificial super intelligence or ASI the benefits of ASI are science fiction like in their implications in essence an ASI would be an inexhaustible hyper intelligent super being with the ability to process and analyze any amounts of data in ways that we can't even comprehend yet and if you're wondering how do I sign up to join the weit list for Asi access well sorry to disappoint but artificial super intelligence isn't here just yet it's a hypothetical software-based AI system more advanced than any human so let's take a look at ASI and see first of all is it even possible the benefits it might bring and the potential risks if there are any I mean off hand I can't think of any obvious drawbacks of an AI more advanced than every human alive I'm sure it'll be fine so look to illustrate how far off ASI is from this moment it Bears mentioning that the current level of AI is referred to as artificial narrow intelligence or a ni this is where we are today now narrow AI excels at specific tasks like playing chess or translating languages but it cannot learn new skills or develop a deep understanding of the world it relies on pre-programmed Al algorithms and data and requires human intervention to operate so that's where we are now the next immediate Frontier is artificial general intelligence AGI now AGI can understand the world and learn and apply problemsolving intelligence as broadly and flexibly as humans can AGI would be capable of cross-domain learning and reasoning with the ability to make connections across different fields now true AGI is yet to be developed it's not here yet but it is the stated goal of many leading AI organizations today so if AGI can match the capabilities of human experts across all cognitive tasks a SI goes the next step exceeding those expert human capabilities well is that even possible you know what that is a very good question is ASI possible well let's see not all thinkers are aligned on the feasibility of something like an ASI human brains are incredibly complex and capable of remarkable creativity problem solving and critical thinking so for Asi to be feasible we're going to need a number of things one of those is far more advanced learning algorithms they'll need to be inspired by how the human brain learns to enable AI to improve it performance over time this continual learning will allow AI to acquire knowledge and adapt to new situations without explicit programming now today we do have a number of precursors to ASI generative AI that demonstrates the increasing sophistication of AI in understanding and responding to human language now it's not sentient but this ability to understand and respond to human language in a natural way is an important building block for achieving human level intelligence and is a level of sophistication that seemed perhaps decades away just a few years ago before the Advent of the Transformer architecture so assuming ASI might happen one day let's talk about what some of the building blocks are to make it so how can we build ASI well this is speculation this is not something that exists yet but some of these building blocks are here today so for example we already have large language models ASI would require access to massive data sets to learn and develop an understanding of the world and natural language processing in large language models will help ASI understand natural language and Converse with humans another building block is multi- sensory Ai and that will enable the ASI to process and interpret multiple types of data input so text images audio video that sort of stuff to perform tasks and to make decisions and we're also seeing big advancements today in multimodal AI models so this building block is coming along now if we think about the neural network for the ASI the neural network would need to be far more complex and Powerful advance than the systems of today but we' need some other advances as well so just as neural networks are modeled on human brain operation there's a new type of computing we might need to use here this is called neuromorphic Computing now neuromorphic Computing are hardware systems inspired by the neural and syntactic structures of our human brain and alongside of that we also have evolutionary Computing as well which may form a part of ASI and evolutionary Computing is a form of algorithmic optimization inspired by biological evolution so evolutionary algorithms solve problems by iteratively performing a a by performing a population of candidate solutions by mimicking effectively the process of natural selection so all of these building blocks will prove to be important in a SI and there's probably a whole bunch of other advances that we haven't even thought about yet all right let's let's wrap this up with a good oldfashioned benefits and risk analysis for Asi now in the benefits column I think we have to add decision making so AI ASI decision making will elab human agents to make the best possible decisions and solve the most complex problems facing things like Health Care Finance scientific research politics and well really every industry another one would be problem solving now ASI Advanced thinking could be enough to solve some of the most persistent medical puzzles to develop life-saving medicines and treatments and unlock the mysteries of physics and Aid Humanity's goal to exploring the stars and then if we move a bit more down to earth we also must consider error reduction with its abilities to significantly reduce human errors particularly in programming and risk management ASI could write and debug programs and deploy robots to perform dangerous physical tasks that humans don't want to do like bomb diffusing or deep sea exploration and then I think we should also consider creativity as well ASI's Superior creativity and its ability to analyze vast amounts of data might lead to Solutions humans can't even imagine resulting in hopefully better quality of life and perhaps even a prolonged quality of life at that you know this sounds awesome I really am looking forward to signing up to this weight list but perhaps we should take a balanced view of ASI by considering the risks now one teeny tiny risk is existential yeah a core worry is that ASI could surpass human control and become self-aware potentially leading to unforeseen circumstances it's Superior cognitive abilities could allow it to manipulate systems or even gain control of automated weapons it seems like that would be bad um another one is automation now what I mean mean by that is automation through ASI could lead to widespread unemployment causing economic and social turmoil exasperating existing inequalities and disrupting entire Industries yeah uh on a rooll here let's go to ethics so ethics come into play here simply programming ASI with human ethics and morality is complex since there is no universally agreed upon set of moral codes doing so could lead to ethical dilemmas and potentially harmful consequences especially especially if ASI begins to operate outside of human control and uh yes as for goals an ASI could pursue goals that are basically detrimental to humanity although they might seem beneficial on the surface but without proper interventions its Advanced systems might not align with our human values there's basically a lot that could go wrong here so this is ASI the potential impact is immense with the potential to revolutionize various aspects of human life but AI researchers computer scientists and World governments must carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of ASI to ensure that this transformative technology is used responsibly and ethically for the betterment of humanity assuming of course the ASI ever arrives at all if you like this video and want to see more like it
