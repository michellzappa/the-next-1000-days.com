[Music] good afternoon everybody I'm Andrew Ros sorin it is a privilege to have with me Peter teal this afternoon uh one of the great legendary investors in Silicon Valley um he has been involved in just about everything that you touch and feel um including being the co-founder of PayPal the co-founder of paler he made his first outside investment uh made the first outside investment I should say in Facebook his firm Founders fund uh is a big backer of stripe and SpaceX his firm backed numerous other startups through the founders fund and teal Capital uh he also started the teal Fellowship uh to your program that's an alternative to a college degree which I want to get to uh at one point and more importantly than all of it he has touched um some of the people and found the people who uh you read about in the headlines every day from Mark Zuckerberg to Elon Musk to Sam Alman and so many others and it is great to have you here thanks for having me um we're also going to talk a little Politics as well um along with maybe some of the issues and culture uh conversations that are happening in Silicon Valley but here's where I want to start the conversation because I want to start the conversation talking about people because I think there's something actually extraordinary when you think about your track record over the years of involving yourself in investing uh not just in companies But ultimately in people uh you wrote a book which is coming on a 10year anniversary um and by the way I reread it and it stands up in a very big way it is called 0o to one and you wrote The Following uh about Founders the idea of Founders you wrote that the lesson for business is that we need Founders if anything we should be more tolerant of Founders who seem strange or extreme we need unusual individuals to lead companies Beyond mere incrementalism and I mention that because I also just mentioned a number of individuals which we read about all the time and some of those people would be described as unusual perhaps or even strange and I'm curious about how you think over the years you have found these individuals what it is that has made these individuals as successful as they have become yeah uh it's it's obviously if if there was some simple magic formula this is what a Founder looks like and you invest in um this category of people who's a Founder um it probably gets faked it's like I don't know it's a um it's a 20-year-old with a T-shirt and jeans or something like this or you end up with all kinds of uh really fake ideas um but uh but yeah I think a lot of the the great companies um that have been built over the last uh over the last two decades were um you know somehow they were founded by people where it was somehow deeply connected to their identity their life's life project uh they had some kind of some you know idiosyncratic diff somewhat different vision of what they were doing they did something new uh and then uh uh they they built something um extraordinarily big over over the years and and of course they they have uh these sort of extreme personalities often have a lot of blind spots and there sort of are all these you know ways in which it's a feature and there ways in which it can be a little bit buggy but uh there it's it's sort of a package deal and I I net out to it being you know massively advantageous uh versus let's say a professional CEO being brought in that you know the prehistory of this I would say would be in the 1990s the Silicon Valley uh formula was you had various people found the company and then You' replace them as quickly as possible with a professional CEOs professional management and there variations of this that happened with Netscape and Yahoo and even Google all all these sort of all these companies and uh sort of the Genex people founded them the Baby Boomers came along and sort of took over the company and stole them from the Gen X Founders in the 9s in the in the 2000s uh when the Millennials founded the companies they were given they were given more of an opportunity and it made a big difference you know the the fa the Facebook story I always tell is uh it was you know 2006 two years in um Zuckerberg was like 22 years old um and we got A1 billion do offer to sell the company to Yahoo and um and we had a board meeting there were three of us and you know we we thought we should at least talk about it it was a lot of money Zuckerberg would make $250 million and sort of an 8 hour long discussion and he didn't know what he'd do with the money and uh he just started another social networking company kind of like the one he had and he didn't know what else he would do and so he really didn't want to really didn't want to sell and um if you had a professional CEO it would have just been man I can't believe they're offering us a billion dollars and I'm going to try not to be too eager and we better you know we better uh take the Money and Run and uh and yeah that getting that that one thing right makes makes a big difference let me ask you a different question and it it all of these individuals had a huge impact on society um and have an enormous individual power and I think one of the things that you've argued in this book and you've argued over the years is that we need to give them that power we need to offer them a Latitude that in many ways we don't offer others well uh well I think I think the um you know I you know one of the one of the frames I always have is that um there are many ways in which um the United States the you know the developed countries have been relatively stagnant for the last 50 years um you know progress has slowed we've had you know we had progress in computers internet software and many other domains things have kind of stalled out and it sort of manifests in low economic growth in the sense that the younger generation is going to have a tough time doing as well as their parents and there is sort of this this way that uh um there has been this broad stagnation for uh 40 50 years and we need to find ways to do new things I I don't think you know startup Tech startup companies are the only ways to do them but that is that is a vehicle for doing it and uh and yeah if you don't uh if you don't allow these companies to have a certain latitude um and flexibility to to try do new new things if you shut it down right away you know the stagnation will be will be worse than ever okay but here's a here's a separate almost philosophical question I'm going to read back something you said to the New Yorker there was a piece about Sam Alman this is be this is right around actually when open AI began 2016 and I think it actually might it might even be representative of how you might think about Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk or some of these other kinds of major players uh this is what you said you said Sam's program for The World Is Anchored by ideas not people and that's what make it makes it powerful because it doesn't immediately get derailed by questions of popularity and I thought that that was actually very indicative of most of the people that you have invested in it's really been about ideas and in some ways you could even argue is disconnected from people it's uh you know I I think it is really about a whole white people are they're able to think about a wide spectrum of things they're able to think about you know that good Founders have theories of how to hire people how to manage them how to build teams they have theories about where the culture of the society's work going going they have technical things about the product the design um they have ideas about how they should Market their company so they they're they're sort of polymaths are able to think about you know a lot of these things but yeah I'm biased towards uh a lot of the the ones where it's it's um it's it's more intellectual and and it maybe um but I think that quote has held up pretty well with with Sam Alman maybe maybe he needed to pay a little bit more attention to the uh the board and things like that there was probably a people Dimension that that he he had ignored a little bit too much in November 2016 so it's since since we're on the Sam Al of it all and since Sam was here yesterday I'm so curious you were a mentor of his um what do you think of open Ai and what do you think of AI more broadly right now I mean are we in a bubble is this the future what is this wow this that's a broad question I I uh I think um I'm always hesitant to talk about it because I I feel there's so many things I would have said about AI where I would have been very wrong 2 three years ago um so maybe I'll start by just saying a little bit about the the history of what I what people thought was going to happen and then the surprising thing that uh open I I achieved and that did happen and if you were had this debate in the 2010s uh there was sort of one one maybe frame in terms of two paradigms uh two books there was the uh there was the Bostrom book super intelligence 2014 which is that um AI was going to build this Godlike superhuman intelligence this was it was heading towards this Godlike Oracle that was what um AI was going to be and then there was the Kaiu Lee rebuttal 2018 AI superpowers which was sort of way the CCP rebuttal to Silicon Valley that no AI is not about Godlike intelligence that's a science fiction fantasy Silicon Valley has AI is going to be about um you know machine learning data collection uh it's not um it's not conscious it's not any of these weird things uh it's it's surveillance tech and and China is going to beat the Us in the race for AI because we have no qualms about uh sort of this totalitar not the word he used collection of data in our our society and that was sort of the way the uh the AI uh debate got framed and then you know the thing I always said was man it's just such a weird word it means all these different things it's it's annoyingly undefined um but then the uh the sort of surprising and strangely unexpected thing that happened is uh that uh in some sense what o Open AI with chat GPT 3.54 achieved in late 22 early 23 was you passed the touring test which um was not super intelligence it's not Godlike it's not uh low Tech surveillance but that had been the Holy Grail of AI for 60 or 70 years and it's a it's a fuzzy line the Turing test is you have a computer that can convince you that it's a human being um and it's a somewhat fuzzy line because sometimes but but it pretty clearly hadn't been passed before it pretty clearly is passed now and that's a that's a really extraordinary achievement it's extremely it raises all sorts of interesting big picture questions what does it mean you know you know you know what what is what does it what does it mean to be a human being in 2024 you know the sort of the placeholder answer I would have been tempted to give a couple of years ago would be something like I don't know the gome Chomsky idea that you know something very important about language this is what sets humans apart from all the other animals we talk to each other and we have these rich semantic syntax things and so if a computer can um replicate that you know what does that mean for all of us in this room and so it's a it's it's a it's an extraordinary development and it was also somehow even though it had been the Holy Grail somehow the last decade before it was not expected at all and uh and so there's yeah there's something you know very significant about it and very underrated and of course you get all these questions about you know is it going to is it a the econ one question is is it a compliment is it going to make people more productive or is it a substitute good where it's going to replace people so what do you think of all of this and and how bullish as an investor are you on this and what do you think our society is when you hear Sam mman talk about this you say he's right that's what it's going to be do you think it's going to be something else you lived through 1999 there's some people who say this is uh you know a hype cycle other people say this is the future well it's um I I I'm I'm I'm very anchored on the 99 history and I and I I somehow always like to say that 99 was both it was um you know the the peak of the bubble was also in a sense the peak of clarity people could realize the new economy was going to replace the old economy the internet was going to be the you know this the most important thing in the uh 21st century and people were right about that and then um the specific Investments were incredibly hard to make um and even the the no-brainer market leader so you know you said 1999 the no-brainer investment would have been Amazon stock it's a leading e-commerce company and they're going to scale and they'll get bigger and it uh peaked in December 99 at $113 a share it was5 a half dollars in October 2001 22 months later um you then had to wait till the end of 2009 to get to back to the 99 highs and then if You' waited till today you would have made 25 times your money from 99 but You' First lost You' have gone down 95% and then made 500x so even even the the no-brainer investment from 99 was uh was wickedly tricky to to pull off um in in in retrospect and I I sort of think that uh AI um the llm form of AI is a large language models large language of the world again um that that that's that passing the touring test I I think it's roughly on on the scale of the internet and um so it's an incredibly important thing it's going to be very important socially politically philosophically about all these questions about meaning um and then and then the uh the financial investment question I find unbelievably hard and confusing and um yeah it's it's probably quite tricky if if I if I had to you know if you had to sort of concretize it one thing that's that's very strange about the uh you know if you sort of just follow the money at this point 80 to 85% of the money in in AI is being made by one company it's Nidia it's all and so it's all on this sort of very weird Hardware layer which uh Silicon Valley doesn't even know very much about anymore you know you know we don't really do Hardware we don't do silicon chips in Silicon Valley anymore I I get pitched on these companies once every three or four years and it's always I have no clue how to do this it sounds like a pretty good idea but man I have no clue and we never we never invest you know and so um and then there's sort of this theory that you know the the hardware piece makes the money initially then gets more commodified over time and it'll it'll shift to software and the I don't know the multi-trillion dollar question is that is that going to be true again this time or you know or will envidia sort of have this uh this incredible monop what's your at the moment uh I I I I suspect Nvidia will um I I think I think it will um maintain its position for a while the you know I I think the game theory on it is something like um all the big tech companies are going to start to try to design their own AI chips so they they don't have to do the 10x markup to Nvidia and then um and then how hard is it for them to do it how long will it take um if they all do it then um then the chips become a commodity and nobody makes money in chips um and so then um then you know do you do you do do you go into hardware and you should do it if nobody else is doing it if everybody does it you shouldn't do it and then maybe I'm not sure how that Nets out but probably people stay uh stay stuck for a while and Nidia goes from strength to strength for a while I have a related but maybe personal question for you you happen to have this very interesting relationship with Sam Alman and then also a very interesting relationship with Elon Musk uh you both worked at uh PayPal you famously were part of a coup effectively to push Elon Musk out of the company you're now friends with him all over again and have a stake in SpaceX you can maybe walk us through that friendship um we had some rough moments in 20002000 2001 but we we can get into that if you want but we're always going to go with this actually is one of the things that's been fascinating and fascinating to the valley and I think to the country has been the commentary we've heard from Elon Musk who helped build open AI with Sam and the break actually between the two of them as creating this not for-profit um and what's happened to it in fact Elon Musk originally sued uh Sam earlier this year and then dropped the suit recently but how do you think about this idea of a company that was was started as a non for-profit and all of the safety concerns and things that you hear from from Elon on one side and Sam on the other um man it's it's whichever person I talked to last I find the most convincing probably so um so you know I I I talked to Elon about it and uh he made this argument um it's just completely illegal for a nonprofit to become a for-profit company because otherwise everyone would set up companies as nonprofits and take advantage of the tax laws and then you turn them into a for-profit and this is the most this is the most obvious ARB and um they just can't be allowed to do this it's obviously just totally illegal what what Sam's trying to do at open Ai and um and then like half an hour after the conversation was over I was think I I in the moment it's like oh that's a really strong argument um and then half an hour later it's like um but you know the whole history of open AI is that the biggest handicap they had was a nonprofit and it it it led to all these crazy conflicting things um uh culminating in this uh this nonprofit board that thought it was better to shut down um the company or the whole venture or whatever you want to call it uh rather than keep going and uh and nobody is ever going to take the lesson from opening eye to start a nonprofit and turn it into a for-profit later uh given what a what a what a total disaster that was but uh yeah whoever I listen to last I find I I find the most compelling let me ask you a different question you uh you left Silicon Valley you have now moved to Los Angeles that's your home we left San Francisco specifically yeah we sort of Francisco specifically it it was it it just felt it was time to get out so tell us why it was time to get out because I think a lot of the issues that actually we read about whether around an open Ai and some of the culture issues add a lot of these companies are the reason you decided you didn't want to live there anymore it was um man it's it's it's it's hard to it's uh a bunch of things that came together but it was uh there was there was a sense that um it was sort of the ground zero the most unhinged place in in in the country it was uh you had this you had this catastrophic homeless problem which maybe is not the most important problem but sort of a and it was it was never getting better you had uh it it was by by 2018 when we moved to LA it it felt like it had become extraordinarily self-hating where um you know everybody who is not in Tech hated the tech industry and this would be this is very odd it would be like the people in Houston hating oil or people in Detroit hating cars you know um people in New York hating Finance um and uh so it had it had this uh it had this unhinged self-hating uh character in in in the city itself and there were all these things that uh seemed um extraordinarily unhealthy and and uh if you asked me in 2021 you know I I would have said uh man they are they are finally you know yes they're sitting on the biggest you know it created all this wealth and yet they are going to succeed in committing suicide uh 3 years later you know I think the jury's a little bit more out because may maybe maybe the AI Revolution is big enough that it will save even the most uh you know I don't know the most uh the most ridiculously mismanaged city in the country it seemed to me tell me if I'm wrong I thought that part of the issue that you had um with San Francisco was the politics of it um and and and not just the politics of it but how politics had seeped into the culture of so many of the companies um and a feeling I I think that you thought that it had moved in a very Progressive Way yeah that's that's always that's always a that's always a very clear dimension of it but uh and that's sort of the tip of the iceberg that's the part that's above the surface that people always focus on and it and then the part that's you know below the surface is um is just the uh the Deep corruption the um you know the misman man agement of the schools the buses all the Public Services the way things don't work um the way the zoning is the most absurd in the country um you know there was I don't know there was a house I was looking to buy where um you couldn't uh you couldn't build uh access into the garage and uh Gavin Newsome who's the lieutenant governor of California at the time uh said he'd help me get a garage access permit and again it's not clear that's what the lieutenant governor of the fifth largest economy in the world should be doing get but he said he knew how to do this in San Francisco and um this Circ 2013 and then um and then uh you know you needed to get it you needed to get the neighbors to sign off which was maybe doable and then you needed to go to the Board of Supervisors because you had to build a a staircase and it was a public walkway and that the whole public had a comment nobody knew what happened then but then even harder there a tree had grown where the driveway was supposed to be and you needed a tree removal permit and this was the sort of thing that um that you would you would never get and so you can describe all this as like crazy left-wing ideology but I think it's more you know it's more like you know really really deep corruption and then this is you know this is in a way the San Francisco problem it's the it's the uh it's the California problem the analogy I have um if you want to think about the the economy of California in some ways it's analogous to Saudi Arabia you have these uh you have these um you know you have a very mismanaged state government um there's a lot of in ideology that goes with it but uh you have these incredible gushers called the big tech companies and uh and then there's a way the the uh the super insane governance um uh is linked to the the Gold Rush of of the place and and so U yeah there's sort of a there's there's some point where it'll be too crazy even for California but California can get away with a lot of stuff you wouldn't get away with elsewhere San Francisco my judgment had gone a little bit too far maybe the AI thing is you know they they found one more giant gusher and you know you don't you don't have any saudy money in your fund I hope uh uh virtually none no just just in case um here's a different question though because it gets to the politics of this which is there's been it seems like a shift inside Silicon Valley um and a shift in in terms even the way the companies are managed um around in a political Dimension um and and and you you were very outspoken obviously uh you you supported president Trump in in the last go round but speak to what do you think and I want to get to that part too but I I want you to speak first to the the shift in the valley at least what seems like a shift perception Wise from being a very Progressive place to maybe less so maybe not maybe it's just the you know Larry Summers and I spoke this afternoon and he said there's you know 10 people he thinks are very loud on Twitter and that's why the world thinks you know that between David Sachs and you know a bunch of other people that and Elon Musk that's that that that's not that's not representative but I think you may have a different view well um you know I I I I I don't I I don't think um you know I I don't think you'll get a majority of tech people to support Trump over Biden or anything like that I think you'll get way more than you had four or eight years ago so you know I don't know if you're you're measuring a relative shift or an absolute number um those those are those are probably two different me measures on that but I I I would say that if if we ask a very different question about let's say um you know extreme wokeness or I don't even know what you're supposed to call it um um uh there is probably uh you know a broad consensus among um the the good Tech Founders startup CEOs people people across a pretty broad range that it's gone way too far I talk to a lot of these people a lot of them are you know I'd say more Centrist Democrats but it is just you know we need to have a secret plan to fight fight this and they are what they tell me behind closed door is way way tougher than what they what they dare say in public and so it is like you know we need to have a plan to hire fewer people from San Francisco because that's where the people the employees are the crazi so if you want if you want to have a less woke Workforce we need to you know we're going to have targets about how we steadily move our company out of San Francisco specifically and and yeah these are these are the sort of conversations that I've and do you agree with this and and by the way let me just read you probably know you probably know um Alex Alex Wang CEO yes uh who said that he's he's put together what he calls a a merit-based hiring program he said he's getting rid of Dei it says hiring on Merit will be a permanent policy at scale it's a big deal whenever we invite someone to join our mission and those decisions have never been swayed by Orthodoxy or virtue signaling or whatever the current thing is I think of our guiding principle as Mei Merit excellence and intelligence Bill Amman went on to say that he thinks di is actually inherently a racist and illegal movement yeah I I um again my my my my feel for there aren't that many people who are willing to say what Alex says but I think there are an awful lot of people are pretty close to thinking this that uh you know there were there were ways they they leaned into the um the Dei thing uh it it was like an anti-trump thing it was like a you know everything was sort of polarized around Trump for the last uh for the four years of his presidency and so um you know you have to demonstrate that you're anti-trump by being even more Pro that's of course not necessarily A logical thing but yes people somehow ended up ended up in this in this in this place that was uh that was very different and then you know there probably um there always are questions what drove the the Dei movement the the wokeness in these companies and uh it probably is overdetermined you know there um there probably is a there's a bottom up you know woke Millennial people who were brainwashed into di in their colleges that's sort of the bottom up um Theory there's sort of a I don't know there's sort of a cynical corporate version where this is uh you know the leadership of the company either believed it or used it as sort of a um as a way to to manage and control their companies in certain ways um you know the part that I I always feel is a little bit underestimated is there was probably also some top down level um from uh government regulatory point of view where um you know if you if you don't do EI there is some point where you get you do get in trouble you know if if you if you know I I don't know this is part of the ESG movement no I mean look we talk we talked about ESG here for long time there was an ESG movement and then there were yeah probably all all these these governmental versions and so I don't know this this would be probably if my candidate for the company in Silicon Valley that's still probably the most woke would be would be something like uh like Google and it's less woke than it was 2 three years ago but uh in some way you know they have a total Monopoly in Search and so there's sort of some way in which you know um if wokeness is a luxury good like um you you can you can afford it more if you're a monopoly than if you're not and then um and then the problem you know for for Google as as a pretty big Monopoly is um that it's always going to be you know subject to a lot more regulatory pressure from the government and so if you have something like the Gemini U the Gemini um um AI engine and you you know and uh it it sort of sort of this comical absurdist thing where it generates these black women Nazis you know and you're supposed to find famous uh famous Nazis and then the diversity Criterion gets applied across the board and so it just uh generates uh fake black women who are Nazis which is you know a little bit too Progressive I think but uh but uh but then but then if you think of it in terms of this larger political context um Google will never get in trouble for that the FDC will never sue them for misinformation or anything like that that that's not that that stuff does not get fact checked um you don't really get in trouble and you probably even get some protection where okay you know um you are you're you're going along with uh the woke directives from the ESG people or the government maybe you overdid it a little bit but we we we trust you to be good at other things so the there may be a very different Calculus if you're a sort of a large quasi regulated Monopoly let me ask about large quasi regulated monopolies and also concentration but I want to read you this is something you actually wrote in your book 10 years ago about Google and it being a monopoly you said since it doesn't have to worry about competing with anyone it has wider latitude to care about its workers its products and its impact on the wider World Google's motto don't be evil is in part a branding Ploy but it's also characteristic of a kind of business that's successful enough to take ethics seriously without jeopardizing its own existence in business money is either an important thing or it's everything monopolists can't afford to think about things other than making money non- monopolists can't in a perfect competition a business is so focused on today's margin that it can't possibly plan for a long-term future only one thing can allow a business to transcend the daily brute struggle for survival Monopoly profits were you writing in favor then of the Monopoly idea or against oh I um I I I will I I well look my my my book was giving you advice for what to do and um um and from the inside you always want to do something like what Google did if you're starting a company you know um you know it's always uh competition is for losers or you know capitalism and competition people always say they synonyms I think they're antonyms because you know um if you have perfect competition you compete away all the capital if you want to have darwinian competition be rad and tooth and Claw you should open a restaurant it's like an awful awful business you never make any money it's perfectly competitive and completely non- capitalist and so uh so from the inside um you want to always go for for uh for something like like Monopoly uh and then um and then yes there are in other parts of my book I also qualify it that uh you know there are you know there are Dynamic monopolies that invent something new that create something new for the world and we reward them with patents or you know or the sorts of things like that that that they get um and at some point there's always a risk that uh that these monopolies uh go bad that they become like a you know like a troll collecting a toll at a bridge that they're not Dynamic and that they sort of become fat fat Are We There Yet I mean Lena Khan if she was sitting here would say we got there a long time ago um I I think um man I I I there all these uh all these ways I would uh I would if if I had to defend Google um um and I I would still say that uh that um it's uh uh it's it is um it it's still better run even in its silly woke way even in a in a slightly troll like uh toll collecting way than um whatever uh uh completely destructive path lenina KH would have for the company and so uh we're still getting more good from from Google do you feel that way about all the big tech companies do I mean you you have lots of investments in smaller companies that need to access the App Store on Apple's phone do you say to yourself that that should be opened up do you say they they created the store there therefore they should control the store how do you think about that kind of stuff um there's sort of our there yeah there there sort of our a lot of complicated questions on all these things it's obviously yeah they're much bigger we're in a very different place from where you were you were uh 10 years ago on these things I I still worry that in many cases uh the remedy is worse than the disease a lot of these businesses are you know um you know if you have a natural monopoly um the remedy is not to break it up the remedy is to it's like a utility company and then the remedy is to you know U regulate it or tax it or or do various things like that so if you if you could convince me that we are a static as a utility company then um then maybe the the remedy is to um is is to do something like that but uh but you know the you know to to the extent the the the the the the the real Monopoly problems in our society I think are are much more these old economy racket like companies you know I I spent three months uh um during covid in in Maui um and uh there's like a there's a single Hospital in Maui and the line the Hawaii island and there was sort of this line if you have a pain get on a plane because it's a local racket it's completely mismanaged and and that's probably you know the the really dysfunctional Monopoly in our society are these um you know pretty big ones that control these local markets and uh that are uh you know 100% troll collecting and I I think uh yeah I I think even with all my misgivings about something like Google it is uh it's a vastly um morally Superior place to uh to your local hospital how do you feel about it in the context of AI which is to say that if you believe AI is this transformative product and that there's only going to be three or four players who are going to control all of these models whether it be Google or Microsoft with open AI or maybe an Amazon along the way I don't know where you think apple is going to land in this in this conversation but is that a good thing or a bad thing and also I would argue even as an investor who looks at startups how do you even look at startups down the line that could effectively get competed away because I'm going to basically build my app with AI and I'm just going to copy what you've made well I I think I I think it's uh I I think it's in a very different place from the consumer internet type businesses or uh which yeah there's been a history they've been around for for decades if I you know if I had to make the anti-google argument it would be you know they they they won at search in 2002 and there's been no serious competition for 21 22 years they beat M Microsoft and Yahoo in 2002 and um and then um you know it's somehow very hard to uh to uh to disrupt that um and then I think uh I think the AI piece is extremely fluid it's extremely hard to know um it's very hard to know where the the value is and as I said it's like the the obvious Monopoly right now is uh is NVIDIA and um but it it it doesn't seem that durable that's you know I mean if you thought Nvidia is as durable as Google I mean the Stock's really cheap you should just you should just buy it um um like like crazy uh and so so the the market pricing is telling you is yeah they have a temporary Monopoly but it's it's it's not very robust and then on the yeah on the level of the uh of the software companies I I worry that uh it's um um you know open AI has a lead uh all sorts of other people you know are going to be able to catch up pretty quickly and uh it's uh yeah if you have three or four doing the same thing that's a lot more than one um PIV very very very different set of Economics I want to Pivot the conversation again because another investment that you've made and been very public about is Bitcoin um and you have uh remained a very big bull uh you have come out publicly and you said that Enemy Number One uh to bitcoin is uh the sociopathic Grandpa from Omaha uh that you described as Warren Buffett can you tell me what you were thinking when you said that it got a lot of laughs so somehow people uh it it it probably had some kind of a some kind of a nerve but um it uh uh it was um it the the uh you know the in in it was in in a 2022 uh Bitcoin convention talk I gave and uh and the I there were there were three separate enemies there was Jamie Diamond uh Larry Larry Larry who's no longer an enemy by the way yeah he sort of he sort of shifted but maybe maybe I I'll I can say some anti Larry f things too but um and then there was uh and then there was uh Warren Buffett and the the uh the rough context was uh you know I my my my sort of I know political sociological analysis was the cryptocurrencies were it was a revolutionary youth movement but for them to really take over you needed you needed um it couldn't just be a student uprising like 1968 you needed to get the rest of the society on board and um and as long as the old people were going to sit on their hands um that was the big blocker for um for cryptocurrencies to to go to the next level and uh are you still convinced I I think it's gotten partially unlocked with the uh the um the the Bitcoin ETF um um uh um but then there you know probably the the part where I'm um less less convinced of is this this question of um the sort of ideological founding vision of Bitcoin or these cryptocurrencies as sort of a you know um Cipher Punk crypto Anarchist libertarian anti- centralized government thing you know this is always you know the line isn't that what got you interested in the first that's what that's that's what I that's what I uh that's what I thought was terrific about it and and then you know the question is does it really work that way or you know has that thread somehow gotten lost and so when people in the FBI tell me that they'd much rather have criminals use Bitcoin than $100 bills um it suggests that maybe you know maybe it's not quite not quite working the way it was supposed to have you sold any of your Bitcoin uh I I still hold some I yeah I've you know there there were all these ways I I I I didn't buy as much as I should have um and uh I I I I'm I'm Pro I I'm not I'm I'm not sure it's gonna go up that dramatically from here from here yeah I think we got the we got the ETF Edition and I don't know who else who else buys it quickly from here some interesting investment advice uh that that that actually surprised me because I I don't think I've heard you I thought you were still all in it um I I still have a small position it it probably still can go up some but it's going to be a volatile bumpy ride and uh and uh I am I'm I I was I had a dual dual reason one was the sort of you know ideological decentralized future of computing world that I I really do believe in really believe would be would be better and it seemed like the perfect vehicle for that for for such a long time and I'm I am just much less convinced of that so I interesting so may maybe so maybe maybe Larry Frink with the um Black Rock ETF surrendered to the forces the anti-g forces or maybe um um uh it's it's more like bitcoin's been co-opted by by them and I I I worry it was more the latter okay different question uh SpaceX that's another big investment for you you after asking uh Elon Musk you you became friends with them again what does that look like to you in the future is that is that going to be the biggest and best investment you've ever made when this is all said and done um man it's uh it's I'm I'm always sort of hesitant to to um to uh uh to sort of pitch um Pitch these companies um too much but um I think uh yeah I there was sort of a lot of different different things that came together uh you know when Elon was building both Tesla and SpaceX in the 2000s I mean people thought you know he was just really really crazy and I think you know even even a lot of those of us who' work with him at PayPal there was you know this I know there's this PayPal book that uh uh David sax and I thought of writing and the you know the um the Elon chapter was um I think titled something like the man who knew nothing about risk or something like this and you know all these crazy Elon stories I could tell and then um and then you know if if one of the two companies had succeeded you would say well maybe he still got really lucky but when two out of two companies that people thought were completely hairbrained in the 2000s when they they both succeed um man you have to you have to somehow reassess it and somehow the rest of us somehow are too risk averse there's something about risk he knows that we don't or or something like this um and uh and so yes I I think there's um and then you didn't invest in Tesla we we we did not invest in Tesla we you know we we should have invested we should have invested in that one it was it was public at a much earlier date and then you know there's always sort of a you know self-imposed limitation that we tend not to invest in public companies Al you know there 20% of a venture fund you could but uh but that was sort of the the uh and I I I think I think the they started Tesla in 2002 it went public in 2010 you know I remember test driving the the model S in October 2012 and um it was just wow this is just a terrific car and um you could have I think the correct thing would have been to wait till they came out with it and then nobody liked it it was such a you know hated stock shorted by everybody and you could have just wait waited 10 years and uh just uh bought the shares in the public market and you would have made 10 times your money in 18 months and 100 times in in the next you know six seven years um seven eight years and um and then um and then there was something also um about SpaceX that looked like it was a very crazy hairbrained idea and yet it was very straightforward you know it was the uh the um the launch rocket launch business um um if you the government will pay or the customers pay for the vehicles before you build them so it's actually cash flow positive from a very you know there's some money they needed for expansion but it was it was basically a cash flow positive business it was a weird investment in 2008 they didn't need any of the money but they there was some um I think some NASA or government rule where they needed outside investors and so um so they were forced to take investors and then you know we we were on good enough terms that we did it and everyone else thought it was too crazy if you had been a Tesla shareholder we've all been reading about it would have you paid him the big compensation package um I would have well I I I think the I think the nuanced answer is I would have voted in favor of the compensation package because you would know that if it failed the share price would have gone down a lot the next day because people would wonder whether Elon would quit and that would be bad for the company so um whether you believe in the package or not the rational thing would be that you should vote for it uh and then uh if you if you think it's a bad idea maybe you sell your shares after you get a pop or something like this so uh and that that that's that's the OB game theory on why Elon was going to win that vote no matter what and uh and it was it was really crazy that that we listened to people in uh the media I'm not sure yourself but uh we all saying it was this hairbrain thing and the shareholders were all going to vote against it and if you just did the basic analysis it was uh it was OB it was obvious Elon was going to win the vote regardless of what the shareholders what did you think of him investing in X did you he he think by the way X is what he wants he wanted PayPal to be did you did you give him money for that um I uh we we we um we did yeah we didn't do we didn't do anything on the on the on the Twitter one we didn't do anything on the uh on the um on the on the current xai company I guess there sort of a lot of different things that have X in the name uh with Elon but um um but it um but yeah it basically uh I I don't know I I I think it was a um incredibly um you know I I do think we need like a broader surface area for debate in our society and so uh and so I think um you obviously are all these very complicated trade-offs between you know how much speech do you suppress how much you know you know how much good speech are we suppressing how much bad speech are we allowing how do you get those trade-offs right very very hard to do my my judgment is you know we should have just um a lot more surface area for debate discussion and uh I think what you know what Elon did with Twitter was I think extremely important and I I I support it as an ideological project I I worry about it as a uh as a financial as a as a financial thing I I don't know if that works you know we we've looked over the years we've looked over and over again you know starting some kind of media company and there's always sort of this thought you could do can't you do something else in the sort of right of Center media space and you know it does it have to all be as lame as Fox News you know can isn't there just an opening to do something else and then uh the question you always have to ask is it you know is it is it the Murdoch family that keeps it lame or is it why do why do you think you called it lame so why do you think it's lame I think it's lame because they're controlled by the advertisers and there's there's a very there's a there's a very narrow limit on what they they can do and then the uh the Elon question with Twitter was um you know are you really allowed to do this and keep the advertisers and so that's that's where um would you make it harder it's super important what Elon did as a as a nonprofit but it's yeah it it may not it it's going to be tough as a what about what about truth social um uh they have a they have a few other problems they have to solve first now something you'd invest in um you get your head around the $6 billion do valuation you know if I if I wanted to secretly funnel money to the Trump campaign violation you get around the campaign limitations so the stock price goes up and he can sell some stock and fund his campaign that might that might be reason to invest do you think people are doing that uh uh I probably not they probably don't think of it in quite quite that literal a term but that's maybe that's what's going you know people have you talked to people in in your realm whove said hey this no nobody's nobody nobody's said that but uh but uh yeah it's probably I I suspect a lot of the investors are going to vote for Trump so so so they're they're thinking about it at least on some subconscious not articulated level sure I want to talk about Trump a little more about Trump just one more second but I want to ask you one La one last related to social media question which is the Surgeon General was here in Aspen um and I I think you probably seen in the last uh couple weeks that he came out and genuinely believes that um social media and the Facebooks of the world really um have done a real disservice to young people in in in the country and I just wonder what you think of that as somebody who invested early in Facebook um man there's uh uh I I I I think you know I I I I can't say that he's 100% wrong um I the place where I always push back on is that I feel it's uh it's too easy to turn Tech or the social media companies into the scapegoat for all of our problems and so yes there's probably there is some kind of a interesting critique one can make of the tech companies um and um and if you ask how many of the executives in in those companies how how much screen time do they let their kids use and there's probably sort of an interesting critique one could make what you do uh not very much and I think that's very what's not very much an hour and a half a week hour and a half a week something like that um how how old how old are your kids three and a half five years 5 years old okay but but um but and I I think that that is sort of if if I had to do the if I if I were to make the anti-tech argument it's that uh there are probably um a lot of people in Tech who do something quite similar for their own families and that and there's some questions that that might lead you to ask and then on the on the other hand um it you know I don't think this is you know uh the main cause for for all of the different types of social dysfunction we have and uh it's maybe it's a 15% 20% cause you know there's you know there's there's sort of a lot of other things that have gone super Haywire in our society and and uh and by by putting all the blame onto you know this this uh um onto Tech or onto one company you are uh you know really ignoring a lot of other stuff we could do a whole panel on this but one related question because we haven't mentioned it Tik Tock do you think of Tik Tok as a national security threat it's um yeah it's it's it's it's it's it's a very it's a it's there's something very strange going on since obviously the Tik Tok algorithms for the US are very different from the bike dance algorithms in China and so would you sh would you shut it down in this country uh I think um I I probably would would lean towards towards a a a tougher response I I think just to shift from the normative to the I don't think we're going to do anything you know I I I met the Tik Tock CEO last summer and I I I I the Singaporean guy not the the Tik Tok CEO and I you I told him he didn't need to worry about it being shut down in the US and maybe I'm wrong but I I think because you know because because because it it will not we are incompetent and slow and bureaucratic and we will never get our act together in dealing with the problems of China until the day they invade Taiwan and then uh it will be shut down within 24 hours and um and since I think there's a 50-50 chance that China will invade Taiwan in the next five years my advice the Tik Tok CEO was you should um take all your people and computers and get them out of China because um once once once Taiwan gets invaded it'll be uh it'll be too late so that's that's my advice but you don't need to worry about us doing anything before then and then his and then his somewhat you know his somewhat I'm not sure good or worrisome answer was that they had studied World War I and World War II very carefully and there were a bunch of companies that were able to trade with all sides in those Wars by the way that implies that he also thinks that China is going to invade Taiwan he he did not you know again it was again I didn't frame it deterministic they said 50% chance five years um we are overtime but we're going to keep going just for a little bit because I I promis you we're going to talk a little bit about politics and I want to talk about your own politics your own personal politics um you were very vocal and outspoken um about uh supporting what who was now the former president the last time um you have been less outspoken this time we're all going to watch the debate tonight so before we even get into the lessons and everything that you've you've learned and all of youri private prior experience are you planning to support the president this time you know um I the former president I should say I you know you hold a gun to my head I I I I I I'll I'll I'll vote for Trump I'll still i' rather I'd rather have him vote than Biden I'm not going to give any money to his super pack and you know I'm going to be be uh be be less involved um in in all these ways and uh and man look it's it's it is um and then I I don't know I I I I think you know I think I think Trump will win I think he will win quite quite solidly it it it it's not I don't think it's going to even be close um and then then my my my pessimistic look ahead function is after he wins there will be a lot of buyers remorse because the elections are AB tests you know it's if you ask me to make a pro Trump argument I I wouldn't but I can probably come with anti-biden arguments and Biden is not going to make an a pro Biden argument he's going to make anti-trump arguments and it's it's these it's these two different hate factories that we have targeted at each other and that's that's the way the politics work and I my my judgment is Trump will easily win that but um yeah the election is a relative Choice the post-election is absolute and then it'll be like you know if Biden wins like how did we get this scile old man and if uh if Trump wins will be wow this is you know can I ask you it's it's still like this this this clown show or whatever whatever people will say I'm not going to ask you to make the the pro Trump argument that's that's sort of understand but let me ask you about what I imagine is your anti-bot argument I look at the last four years and say to myself if you were in Silicon Valley and you owned stock in these tech companies over the last four years they virtually did nothing but go up and I I know I I and I just I wonder if you can make the argument because we can talk about Lena Khan and we can talk about regulations and uh potential taxes and all sorts of things but it's hard for me to look at the last four years and say especially if I was sitting I would imagine in your seat and say this was a this was a terrible travesty but maybe maybe I don't understand well I mean I I I don't know this this may not be believable to you but I you know I I um I I don't think it's uh the only thing I care about is whether the country is good for the tech billionaires and uh and I I I think there are a lot of people who have not experienced the last three or four years this way I I think you know one of the things Carville said in the earlier presentation just before this one that I thought was quite good was you know there's been a shocking loss of support by the Democrats in the you know 18 to 35 year voters and it's because you can't get on the housing ladder um you you can you can you know the college debts overwhelming you can never get started and so there's sort of a sense that uh you think he'll be able to fix that um I don't I there's uh I think it's I think it's it's just an up down referendum on the incumbent at this point and you know the my my guess is that the sensus Biden's definitely not going to fix it and his time will will run out and that's and then and then Pro no and then this is where I'm not overly excited I you know I don't think Trump will particularly fix it but but look the place where people you know at at this in in the audience here I think are just maximally Divergence yes you're you're the stock market has been great for people here um you're in this you know Wonderful bubble in Aspen where it's like I don't know Clinton is still president and it's 1995 and um and uh and everything is just getting better every day in every way and it's like some new age chant if you just say that to yourselves it's true and um and uh and then you know the the the the the part of the Trump statement that I think was um the most offensive thing he said it was very offensive not just to you know Democrats and to republ to lot of Republicans and especially to Silicon Valley was make America great again because that was a pessimistic slogan it was the most pessimistic slogan a major presidential candidate ever had because what it says implicitly is this is no longer a great country right and that's what you are never supposed to say especially if you're a republican this is why the bush people probably hate him more than anybody in this audience you you know and um and uh and then and then Silicon Valley was you know it's it's somewhat offensive to people in New York City but you know the bankers on Wall Street don't really think they're making the country a great place so it's not personally offensive it was personally offensive to to Silicon Valley and uh and yet I I I always think you know there is there is this this problem of stagnation there is this problem we're stuck there's a sense that um you know we are we're not progressing in all these ways as a society as as much as we have I don't I don't think Trump has all the answers uh but I think you know the what I what I said in 2016 is the first step you know towards solving problemes at least talk about them what about the polarization part the polarization part the uncertainty part uh the questions about democracy and the rule of law and the future of of a country and I think there's a lot of people who worry about those things uh sure those are those are all those are all still um those are all still uh those are things you probably wouldn't worry about if if Biden was the President right I I feel the country still very polarized it's it's been getting it's been getting more polarized for decades you know it was it was polarized against Bor in the 80s and you know that was sort of a new Crescendo and polarization there was way Fox News was polarized against the clintons and uh we've been and I you know I don't know it's it's always what's cause and effect is the polarization causing the stagnation or does the stagnation lead to the polarization I don't think the polarization just happens in a country where everything's grow tonal question you come across as a very sensible reasonable person I think I mean there are people who here I'm sure will disagree with you about lots of different issues but my question about about tone about the president what the president and the tone of the president by the way I should say and I'm not I'm not speaking out of school you you also I would say by the way um you've been a public you've been a republican for a long time now public uh about that you're also proudly gay openly so and and I wonder if you can tie you know I think there's a lot of people who say themselves that you know pres presid president Trump when he looks at talks about some of the issues around LGBT issues in this country and other people people there are people in those communities who say they don't feel safe about it yeah well we we can go through all all these all these different different versions of that I I think uh I mean there was never any thought of reversing gay marriage or or any of those things uh um by by by by Trump at least and um and I think the uh and look I think the uh the um yeah there all these ways they are they're not the way I I would articulate these things but um you know the the sort of polite tone uh you know there was um you know people had attempted to say you know something's gone very wrong in our country the house is on fire it's burning to the ground uh we are a society in Decline stagnation where you know I mean maybe AI will will save us but this is like the way people talk about a I just come back to that it's like if if it doesn't lead to this cornucopian growth I mean we're just completely going to be a uh buried by budget deficits uh and debt for decades to come and and uh and it's it's like I I think AI is a big thing uh is it big enough to solve our budget deficit problem I I don't believe it is and uh and so yeah we have we have we have we have a lot of these problems and at some point uh you know uh uh extra politeness is is is not quite the thing yeah it was it was an inarticulate shriek for help and look my my my sort of fantasy in 2016 and supporting Trump this was where I was completely delusional was this would be the way you start to have a conversation and uh we that and and and that's why and that's what that's another reason why I'm off raing I'd much rather have the sort of conversation we had here because if you know if I lean in all the way to support Trump it'll be all about that and we can't talk about all these other things which is the way we are going to substantively solve the problems well I want to thank you for this conversation and for addressing all these issues um it really was a phenomenal discussion thank you so so much thank you very [Music] right
