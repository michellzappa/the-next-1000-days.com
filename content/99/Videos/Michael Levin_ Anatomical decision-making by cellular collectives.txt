let's get started welcome everyone to this physics of life seminar which will be given by professor mike 11 from tufts university thank you everyone for attending so before we get started i just a quick reminder of the usual uh housekeeping thing so please mute yourself to avoid uh feedback but at the same time please also open your chat box and submit questions we might uh ask a few to michael during the talk but the rest can be sent saved for for after the talk if mike has some time to to stick around yeah and um okay let's cut to the chase so it's my great pleasure to introduce professor michael levin um he's a distinguished professor at in the biology department at tufts send out a new bush chair hopefully i pronounce it correctly and as a director of the taft center for regenerative and developmental biology as well as the allen discovery center he won a number of prizes such as the scientist of vision award and the distinguished scholars award and then his career started quite unusually i think with dual bachelor degrees in computer science and biology and from there on he went on to get a phd at harvard university on embryonic development in left right asymmetric asymmetric body structure and now fast forwarding to today through a highly successful career his lab is interested in the bioelectric language of cells says warm intelligence and the rational control of growth and form in particular sentence applications and regeneration and also artificial intelligence so he can correct me if i'm wrong i hopefully i produce this correctly so with our first idea i hand over to to mike and i'm really looking forward to his talk thank you for being here thank you so much uh and it's a real pleasure for me to be here and to have the opportunity to talk to you all and uh if anyone wants to get in touch with me afterwards here uh at these websites are all the primary papers the uh the numbers the data the software everything is here and please feel free to contact me afterwards so um these are the main points that i would like to transmit today um one thing that we will talk about is the fact that there are significant knowledge gaps about the control of large-scale anatomical homeostasis and as engineers we view this as a design challenge so we want to understand it but we also want to implement it from scratch and i think that really fundamental advances in biomedicine is going to require not only understanding the molecular mechanisms but actually the decision-making that occurs in cellular collectives or tissues and i'm going to tell you that one key medium for computation in this area is non-neural bioelectricity so we've developed some techniques to listen in and manipulate the electrical conversations that bind individual cells into very robust large-scale agents that are able to process information and make anatomical decisions it's a kind of physiological software and what we're working on is this notion of cracking the bioelectric code which is the mapping between electrical patterns in the body and genetic and anatomical outcomes and we think that this will enable a kind of electroceutical approach for all sorts of applications and birth defects regenerative medicine cancer as well as uh synthetic bioengineering so if i had to uh boil the whole talk down to about two sentences i would tell you the following that like the brain your body tissues form electrical networks that make decisions these are decisions about dynamic anatomy and now we have ways to target the system to control large-scale pattern editing and to override some genomic defaults and so this we think this has real advantages and so i show you right up front i'm going to say that you in this talk will see all kinds of really weird looking creatures and and and animals and so like here's our five-legged frog and these are not photoshopped these are real uh live animals that exist in our lab and these are models for us in which we test our various theories okay of anatomical structure so in our center we ask a number of fundamental questions about the relationship uh of the the genome to the anatomy uh the question of of of scaling of purpose of activity that is how are competent cells uh working together towards a very large anatomical goals and we ask in practical terms how can we target this process forget for getting better control of the outcome for regenerative medicine synthetic biology and so on and moreover about 30 of my lab is computational so we ask in both directions what can developmental biology learn from advances in computer science and machine learning and in in contrast what can artificial intelligence and uh a life learn from the things that we're discovering in developmental biology so let's first talk about some of these knowledge gaps and and i'd like to introduce this this really important concept of anatomical homeostasis so if we think forward to what is the end game of our activity what's the goal of everything we're trying to do uh one of the most uh important uh central pieces is control of large-scale anatomical structure because if we were able to convince cells to build exactly what we wanted them to build we would basically solve almost all problems of biomedicine so birth defects traumatic injury cancer aging all of this would be addressed if we knew how to get cells to build what we wanted them to build and so i look forward to a day where we have something that i call an anatomical compiler the idea being is that you should be able to sit down and draw the way that we now do with with various machinery parts and so on as if it were a cad system we draw the kind of animal or plant that you want so you specify it at the anatomical level and then if we understood how this process worked the uh the the compiler would be able to give us a set of stimuli that would have to be given signals and stimuli that would have to be given to the individual cells to build whatever it is that we want to build and we've only clearly we are nowhere near this capability in the general case but we've had some specific um specific uh successes such as i'll tell you today about these planarium okay so this is this is the the goal towards which we're working basically complete control of growth and form and so this is an important question because there are a number of uh outstanding big picture items that are still real largely unknown so for example we we all start life as uh as as a group of um these uh embryonic blastomeres descendants of an egg and then this is a cross section of a human torso and you can see this incredible complexity this uh just a a remarkable invariant arrangement of all the tissues and organs that are in the right shape proportion relationship to each other and so on and we know that what the genome actually specifies are proteins and so the question is well where does this anatomical structure come from how do cell groups know what to make and when to stop remodeling as engineers we'd like to know how how much plasticity is there could we get the cells to build something completely different and in regenerative medicine we would like to know if part of this is missing or damaged how do we repair it so let's look at our building blocks unlike in a lot of engineering our building blocks are not passive they're highly competent so this is a single cell and this is known as a lacrim area uh it as you can see here it is it's hunting for for food in its environment this uh creature is incredibly competent on its own single cell cell scale so it solves all of its physiological its behavioral its anatomical needs all in one cell there's no brain there's no nervous system there are no stem cells there's no cell to cell communication everything is solved in one cell and so these are the sorts of uh building blocks that um uh bodies are made of and and the the fascinating thing is that uh the intelligence of these cells did not disappear when they became multicellular structures in fact they scaled their computational capabilities to work towards much bigger goals so instead of single cell goals we have individual cells that make uh tissues and organs and so this is embryonic development you see here reliably this one cell can give rise to uh various progeny that work together to build these remarkably complex uh uh beautiful anatomies and we know that actually simply differentiating cell type is not sufficient because this thing down here this is a teratoma and it's a tumor that might have skin and hair and bone and teeth and muscle so the stem cell biology here has has proceeded correctly in other words you're getting all of your um terminally differentiated tissues but what's missing is the three-dimensional organization and that's what's really uh what we really want to understand so um in standard developmental biology the paradigm looks something like this there are gene regulatory networks so these genes interact with each other some of these genes make effector proteins which are either sticky or they they exert force so they diffuse they have various physical properties and then there's this um process of emergence whereby lots of these complex local interactions happen in parallel and out comes something like this this is a salamander uh that you'll see again the axolotl and so uh so so this is this is all uh the the all of these steps are are correct but but there's a fundamental difficulty here which is that there's a there's a profound inverse problem that if you wanted to make changes out here and you wanted to make this anatomy to be different what would you have to change early on and and trying to reverse this story is is really very difficult i'll show you a very simple example of where we come across this so here are some flatworms i'm going to talk a lot about flatworms today so these are planaria and here are two species one with a flathead one with a round head and we know that the cells of this flathead species when you cut off any part of the body for example cut off the head they are able to regenerate the uh the exact correct shape and then they stop so these so these green cells make a flathead this is a different species these red cells know how to make a round head and they do this 100 of the time um so one one could ask if we take some of these green cells and we transplant them into this body and we and we let them mix around and this works perfectly well you can transplant cells at will here then we amputate the head what head shape are we going to get so is this one shape dominant is it going to be a mix of the two shapes or is there never going to be an end to the regeneration because neither uh type of cell is ever happy about what kind of head is currently being built so they're going to keep going so the important thing is that despite all of the really great papers in science and nature on the molecular pathways that determine differentiation of these cells and there are many such papers we as a field still do not have not even a single model of that makes a prediction in a simple experiment okay so we don't have any models that make a prediction on this at all and so while we're getting really good at the mechanisms that are necessary for this to happen we're really not very good yet at the algorithms that determine uh what the cells are building and what is their actual stop condition so um what we are interested in doing in my group is to trying to move uh biology uh beyond the focus on the hardware or at best the machine code which is you know sort of the the low-level uh molecular signaling which is of course very very critical to understand but we'd like to ask some some higher level questions of the kind that people understand and and and work on in neuroscience so what might some anatomical native modules be that exist in in the organism that we're trying to reverse engineer what are their triggers what do cellular collectives measure how do they detect anatomical error and really perfo sort of central to all this is how reprogrammable is biological hardware you know and so one of the things that i get a lot of inspiration from is the journey of the computer science took so so what you see here this is what uh computer programming looked like in the 40s and 50s so in order to program this she literally has to rewire it physically she has to physically alter the machine in order to get it to do something different and of course the reason we have this amazing information technology revolution now is because computer scientists figured out early on that if the hardware is good enough and i'm going to argue that biological hardware is is definitely good enough then what you can focus on is control of the system via inputs experiences or stimuli not necessarily via rewiring so you can offload a lot of the computational complexity onto the system if you ask what what what are some of the properties of the of the software control not of just of the hardware that already exist in the system and how could we take advantage of this and this allows for much more powerful control as anyone who's tried to program in for example machine language versus a modern high-level language knows and the point isn't to try and make a strong analogy between modern between traditional computer architectures and biology there's certainly many places where that breaks down that's not the point the point is that there's a very uh interesting um aspect of this that uh asks what what is possible with the exact same hardware right without having to rewire the system at the genetic or molecular level so let me introduce uh some of the some examples of plasticity so here for example is an axolotl this animal uh regenerates its limbs its eyes its jaws portions of the brain the heart ovary spinal cord during its lifetime and if you amputate the limb what it will do is uh is is the cells will grow very rapidly and then when they have completed growing a correct salamander arm then they stop and so this is one of the most profound aspects of this which is that uh this is a how do they know when to stop you know this is a self-limiting but very rapid growth process and in addition to that we have this animal so these are the planaria i told you about these guys have a true centralized brain some complex internal organs and so on they can be cut into many pieces the record is something like 257 pieces or something like that and every piece will grow exactly what's needed no more no less and then it stops when it's done so it makes a tiny little worm so in fact they're so highly regenerative they're actually immortal there's no such thing as an old worm they continuously regenerate whatever is missing and so on so uh so so this is an amazing model system to understand this kind of uh plasticity now i should point out that regeneration is not just for so-called lower animals you know the human liver of course is highly regenerative um that's been known for a long time i actually have no idea how the ancient greeks knew that but but they did deer are a large adult mammal that regenerates uh bone vasculature innervation uh every year at the rate of a centimeter and a half per day you know incredible rates of growth and then human children have been known to regenerate their fingertips um after a clean amputation and then usually we lose this ability okay so one one example that um that i want to show you is that that illustrates this uh the the control uh aspects of this plasticity process is this so uh this is something we discovered in our group a few years ago um tadpoles in order to make a frog need to rearrange their face so the eyes have to move the jaws have to move um the nostrils everything sort of has to move around to to transform a typical um tadpole face into a frog face so what was thought at the time was that uh basically every um every organ primordium has is simply a fixed way of movement because every capital looks the same and every frog looks the same so if the starting conditions are the same you just move everything in the right direction the right amount and then you get your frog so what we did was create what we call these picasso tadpoles right here and i'm going to tell you in a couple minutes how we make them and what we discovered was that actually these picasso tadpoles largely make perfectly normal frogs so as uh what happens is all of these different the eye and the jaws and everything else they move through uh abnormal unconventional uh paths to end up where they're going to end up in a correct frog face and when they end up in the correct frog face that's when they stop moving so what the genetics actually gives us is a is a is a system that executes a really flexible program of error minimization it doesn't it's not troubled by the fact that things start off in the wrong configuration it will simply continue to move in a way that minimizes distance from a particular anatomical layout and then it will stop when it's done so now this raises a couple of obvious questions and we formalized it like this so so here's the feed forward aspect of emergence of form but they're really important feedback loops at the level of genetics and of course at the level of physics which is what i'm going to talk about today that uh activate when the animal is deviated from its correct target morphology and this could be injury it could be birth defects it could terradogens it could be a parasites it could be a mutation lots of different things and so um the part here and so and so this this we call this pattern homeostasis because it's very you know most of you will recognize this is a very simple uh homeostatic loop um the the the existence of feedback loops of course is is nothing new biologists are well understand that there are lots of lots of feedback loops everywhere but there are two parts here that are that are novel one part is that the set point of this homeostatic process you know this is this the the process itself is is read the current state compared to the set point and then activate some steps that hopefully get you closer to the set point and then repeat until that delta is significantly smaller um so so two special pieces to this one is that the set point here is not a simple scalar like ph or metabolic level you know hunger or the level of some hormone it's actually a fairly complex information structure that to some level of detail obviously not its individual cell positions but to some level of detail specifies a correct anatomical layout so in the case of that frog face correcting itself it's the rough layout of what a normal frog face is supposed to look like so the set point is complex and it's the it's it's the whole idea that this system is not uh purely emergent from from local interactions but there's actually a uh an explicit representation of a future goal state now that is that kind of talk is conspicuously absent from most developmental biology but textbooks nowadays although that didn't use to be the case because um you know it's it was thought that that we should kind of stay away from from anything that uh that sounds like uh like like a representation of a future goal although uh here we're using it in a very um non sort of non-threatening non-mysterious way but in the sense of cybernetics and control theory that there are a set of states that are somehow represented by cells that guide uh the the way that the system uses energy to rearrange itself so so this is this is a an unusual um hypothesis in this field if it's true it makes a very strong prediction the prediction is that if there is in fact some kind of represented set point we ought to be able to uh edit that information without changing the machine in other words leave the cells exactly as they are so wild-type cells but alter the information that can that uh establishes that set point and thus make the cells build something else so get around the inverse problem in this way by by addressing the the the information structure that's that implements the top down control so so that's the strong prediction and so that's what we've been doing trying to find the mechanisms for this homeostatic set point and see if we can rewrite it and let the cells build to the new specification and i'm going to show you some examples of this okay so so mechanistically we started looking at something called bioelectricity and uh basically most of the things that you you know from neuroscience hold true in in every other cell type in the body uh with the exception that the time is a lot slower so most things in in neuroscience if you simply change the um uh the time scale from milliseconds to uh to to minutes and hours a lot of things still hold true so of course i should point out this is this is critical to say is that i'm going to spend the next half hour talking about bioelectricity as as a key component of this morphogenetic field this is simply a field of information that impinges on cells in in three dimensions uh within the body and of course i'm not making the claim that bioelectricity does everything so clearly there are chemical gradients extracellular matrix tensions pressures oxygen gradients all these sorts of things that are all important uh bioelectricity just happens to be the one that that we work on and i think it's particularly interesting and it would be i think a shame to uh to think of bioelectricity as simply one more mechanism that has to be added to uh all of the complexity that biology uses i think it's actually more than that i think it's a computational layer that gives privileged access to some really interesting top-down controls and uh i think it's not an accident that that the evolution of brains uh from the system actually uh exploited some of these features of of electrical networks but but these same these same features may at some point be discovered actually in these other modalities as well okay so so in the brain we have the following story that the hardware of the brain looks like this there are there are neurons these are cells that use ion channels on their surface to set up bioelectric states these states can propagate under specific conditions to neighbors through gap junctions so these little little electrical synapses are known as gap junctions and uh and this this this combination of steady and propagating states is the electrical activity of the brain and so the commitment of neuroscience is to the this idea that that electrical activity actually encodes the information content of the brain so you have here for example this is um a video of a zebrafish uh brain as the zebrafish is uh processing various inputs and you can see here all the flashing this is this is all the electrical activity and there's this concept of neural decoding the idea is that we read the electrical activity and if we understood how to decode it we would be able to infer the uh semantic content of that information what is the animal seeing what what memories does it have what plans does it have you know the the the cognitive structure of this animal we ought to be able to infer from the electrical activity that's what neuroscience is trying to do and actually there have been some some successes in this area so it turns out that actually all cells in the body do this so all cells in the body have ion channels most cells are connected electrically to their neighbors and these are very interesting gates that gap junctions can open and close under various conditions so these are literally synapses and you can you can port many of the the strategies and the concepts from neuroscience to many other cell types so for example we are interested in reading out here here's an early frog embryo you're seeing that the colors are a voltage sensitive fluorescent dye that is reporting all the electrical states as this time lapse proceeds and this embryo figures out where it should be the left the right the dorsal ventral and and so on and if we if we understood how to decode this thing we would be able to make predictions about gene expression about anatomy uh about various uh future states of the system based on understanding the information processing so we developed uh some tools to do this uh of course these voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes that uh allow us to uh uh just simply get we get maps in vivo of what all the electrical states are and then we do a lot of simulation so if we know what the ion channels and pumps are and the different gap junctions that are present in various cells we could put together a quantitative simulation of why the voltage is what it is and how it relates to these uh to these different uh different channels so let's let's take a look at what some of these patterns look like so here's an early frog embryo uh putting its face together and again this is time lapse this is a voltage die it's in grayscale you can see hyperpolarized and depolarized cells and the reason i'm showing you this example which we call the electric face and this was first discovered by my colleague danny adams um is that the decoding here in this particular case and there are other cases that are much tougher in this particular case the decoding is really simple so when you look at this electrical pattern you can almost see the face so here's where the eye is going to come out the right the the animal's right eye comes out first um here is where the mouth is going to be you've got some black outs out here uh this is this is literally a pre pattern this is a bioelectric pre pattern that drives the necessary gene expression localizations and thus the anatomy of the early frog face this is how we made those picasso tadpoles because this pattern is instructive if you interfere with it and change the electrical properties of these cells and these cells and put them some and put these voltage states somewhere else not moving the cells but moving just the voltage states the uh the face is is going to be is going to be entirely different and so the gene expression and the cell movements and everything else is going to change so this is one example and we i think we got very lucky with this because some other ones require a lot more decoding to really understand what's going on this one is pretty straightforward as far as being able to read out from the electrical activity of the cellular network what shape it's trying to build so that is a natural endogenous necessary pattern in development here's a pathological pattern so what we can do is introduce human oncogenes into these temples they make tumors but even before the tumor becomes uh anatomically um uh or morphologically uh apparent you can already see the aberrant biological and uh and they are about to uh disengage the gap junctions are going to close they're going to disengage from the rest of the uh electrical uh network and uh basically treat the rest of the body as external environment they revert back to a unicellular metastatic lifestyle so these are and then there's some obvious uh applications here for diagnostics and so on hey so my just one second mustafa had a question can i just ask this briefly of course it was about your previous uh part on the planaria yeah question was if they naturally die and if they die um so why do they die if they can completely regenerate yeah the planaria don't die i mean you can kill them and various things eat them and they can be poisoned and they you know they're not they're not invincible of course so there are many things that will kill a planarian but they do not die of old age there's no such thing as that anybody has ever seen of an aging planarian that has died of old age it doesn't it doesn't happen fascinating and it's already on the next slide here again yeah very good great um okay and so and so besides the uh the ability to to observe these patterns of course really critical is to develop uh uh techniques for functional uh intervention so to change the patterns and thus do functional experiments to show that they actually do something so we developed a couple of tools basically very similar to synaptic plasticity and intrinsic plasticity neuroscience basically here here are the two things we can do if we have a non-neural set of cells we can control the topology so we can open or close gap junctions so that we determine which cells talk to each other cells or we can directly uh set the electrical state of the various cells by opening and closing channels these might be native channels these might be channels that we put in these might be optogenetic channels that we can gate via light in all of this i should say there are no electrodes there are no external electric field applications everything i'm going to show you today is molecular physiology so we don't apply any kind of external stimulation to these things we are turning on and off endogenous components of electrical signaling in cells and there's pharmacology and genetics wasted that we do that so let me show you some examples so these are these are early uh examples that we found to show that these bioelectrical signals uh are actually important in determining growth and form because that was certainly not not not expected and not obvious so so one thing you can do is we can introduce in the early frog embryo and mrna encoding one of uh several different channel types and it will set the the the voltage of the progeny of these cells to a specific range and basically establish an eye a voltage eye spot like what i showed you in the electric face when you do this the region that in which you ex you uh you set this up develops into an eye so these so so here's an eye being developed out of gut cells there are two sort of notable pieces to this outside the fact that it's bioelectric one is that it is being done way outside the anterior neural field so master regulators like pac-6 and these kind of genes only induce only induce eyes up here and so it's it was thought that actually the anterior an erected iron is the only tissue capable of making an eye so that's not true lots of uh actually um cell skin locations can make eyes the other interesting thing is that it's extremely modular so these eyes can contain the right internal structure all the same uh cell types that they're supposed to have so so lens retina all that stuff and but the signal that we gave is actually very simple in other words the trigger is quite simple we certainly didn't give it enough information to specify how to make an eye so we think of this as a modular subroutine call as a trigger of a native module that can kick-start appropriate self-limiting morphogenetic cascades and so in this way you can make eyes we can make limbs we can make brains and kind of hearts lots of organs that we don't yet know how to make and this is part of part of cracking this bi-electrocode so here is the planarian story about which uh we'll we'll talk about a little bit now uh when we amputate the head and the tail how does this piece know which end is anterior and which end is posterior so it develops this this really interesting bioelectric gradient where depolarization tends to be at the anterior end hyperpolarization tends to be at the posterior end and if we artificially uh duplicate this let's say turn this apart down here depolarized that you can do this with with with pharmacology targeting ion channels or with rnai i'm knocking down some some pumps then in fact you can generate a two-headed worm and so so these cells back here can be induced to make a proper head again much like here very in a modular fashion you we give it a signal that basically says head goes here and that's what they build you can make worms that have no head and then there's of course interesting behavioral questions that we're asking about this so in this example what i'm showing you is that when you manipulate the standing bioelectric patterns you make uh coherent large scale changes to the anatomy so these are not um this is not a housekeeping parameter because by tweaking it you can control anatomical outcomes this is um and this is not something that causes a toxicity or death it actually is is is a is a is an information carrier that's instructive for outcomes and so what in in this particular case what we've what we've told these cells here is that they need to make a head and they make a normal planarian head that's correctly scaled correctly shaped and so on but we can go further than this and we found that actually if you take uh if you take a planarian and this one has a nice characteristic triangular head shape here you amputate that head you take the middle piece and you uh expose that middle piece to a reagent that blocks these electrical synapses it basically reduces the ability of cells to talk to each other um electrically and when you do this so you do this for about 48 hours then you pull out the drug you let the the electrical network settle back into connectivity and what it will do is it'll settle back down and sometimes it settles back down in a state that makes the correct planarian head and so so it just makes the normal head shape but other times it settles into a different attractor that belongs to an entirely different species so you can get round heads like this s mediterranean you can get flat heads like here like this like this p felina and we can do we've we've done all sorts of morphometrics to compare these things but not only does the head shape change but in fact the shape of the brain and the distribution of stem cells becomes exactly like these other species so without any genetic change remember that the genome of these animals is untouched we haven't done any um dna editing or anything like that you can access regions of the morphospace that belong to other species about 150 million years i would estimate uh distance between this and these and uh this is a stochastic process and the frequency of getting these other head shapes is proportional to the uh predicted genetic difference between the actual species that use that that have these heads so there's a very interesting um evolutionary um story um to be told here and in fact can i just ask something briefly mike sure so if i understand correctly you manipulate essentially is a membrane potential right so for this particular so for this particular experiment what we do is we reduce the electrical coupling between the cells so we basically disconnect all of the cells partially from each other and then we let them connect back up and we and and and the system tries to get back to the correct bioelectrical state but sometimes it fails and it lands in a different uh different stable attractor but i think on one of your earlier slides maybe two back you had i think say symbol for membrane potential so at least it was one of the parameters you apparently were able to influence yeah but of course it's a very a generic parameter so um but if you say um so how how does the sales and know how to reach this out uh ultimately you know to make an eye or another limp i mean there's something very specific going on downstream right sure sure yeah i'm and i'm getting to that we're gonna we're gonna talk about interpretation of the bioelectric code i mean in the end uh what what what actually happens i mean i'll just i'll just uh tell you tell you this the system now so so what happens is very much like in the brain what happens is there's an electrical network that makes decisions at the level of the electrical network in other words it's a circuit that takes inputs and it generates various outputs across the tissue so there's a bioelectric pattern that results across the tissue so think about a standard neural network type of architecture where inputs come in there's some computations and then there's a bioelectric state that comes out that bioelectric state is transduced and i'm going to show you a few of those molecular mechanisms this that part is already known it's transduced into changes in gene expression and into changes of cell behavior motility cell division differentiation all of those things so of course downstream of the bioelectrical decision making is all the typical mechanisms that we know are required for this process so to make an eye you need to turn on a bunch of genes including pac-6 and rick's one and all these different things to make up an eye or a head or whatever the the transcriptional stuff is downstream uh and we know how the coupling works but the real trick which we only understand in a couple of cases so far is to decode very much like in the nervous system is to decode the computational part so what what are what are the uh the the the the processing the representation um and uh and the computations that are happening in that electrical layer before it feeds down to turn on all of the gene expression um domains and so can i sorry can i ask a quick question sure so right when i guess when when i think of platinum formation in the biological setting result typically it's about protein gradients or morphogen gradients right so are you saying that the bioelectric pathway is the master switch that control everything else because obviously uh we reload if you mess up the the protein gradient of in some developmental program then you won't develop or the organism won't develop into the proper of course of course yeah sure sure so okay so so three three things to keep in mind here um first of all the whole notion of a master regulator uh has to be a little bit modified because all of these things are are cycles in other words uh you you can't really ask the question of what is on top because there is no top because every every process no matter what process you pick there's a process before it that gave rise to that process so there's a kind of inter there's a kind of constant interplay between the bioelectrics the the biomechanics and and the biochemistry however what you can ask are uh questions about which node has the most power to control downstream complex events with the least input so so so-called master regulators what's nice about them is that they they give you they give you this this maximal power of a of a simple intervention that makes a very large difference downstream so you can practically pick out some some some nodes in this very complex network that as i said before has you know biochemical gradients of course it has biomechanics and so on you can pick out these nodes and so if we ask so so now we can ask a couple of questions first of all um are are biochemical gradients altered when you change the function of the bioelectrical network and the answer is absolutely so we've seen the distribution of morphogens uh change we've seen gene expression change cell behavior change all of this stuff can be controlled by the bioelectrical network now i am not saying that in every single case under the sun the bioelectrical network is the most efficient control node uh that's i'm sure that's not the case i'm sure there are some situations where the biochemistry drives and there are some situations where the biomechanics drives i'm of course showing you some some examples where the bioelectrics drives because that's what we're interested in but i will also point out that in the examples where we have seen where we have put things head to head uh where there is a um there's a classic um a classic master regulator of some process that's a biochemical or a genetic state or or a chemical gradient and uh and a bioelectric one in in every case that i've seen so far it it has turned out that uh the bioelectrics are the better way to control the system but i'm absolutely not claiming that that's a universal truth i'm quite sure that there will be evolution uh uses whatever is most convenient and i'm sure there will be cases where uh the biochemistry is is a better driver but but for these systems the the things you're talking about are in fact downstream so when we um when we alter these electrical uh electrical states we see everything else change all of the typical markers that people use to see these gradients and everything else every everything changes thank you great so um so so i've shown you how you make uh how to make ectopic uh heads and uh and and change to the heads of other species we can also access regions of the amorphous space that are actually not ex explored by evolution so you make a planaria where the body plane is completely different so it's got this weird spiky shape we can make ones that are instead of flat and bilaterally symmetrical are now radially symmetrical and we can make combinations of flatworms don't even have to be flat so there's really quite a bit of power to alter what genetically wild type cells are going to build and uh the um and we're using it and the goal of course is to is to push this towards a very um predictive uh type of application because here for example we have regenerative medicine um applications in our in our group so here this is a frog unlike a salamander frogs do not regenerate their legs you cut off the leg nothing happens we've come up with a bilectric cocktail that stimulates the wound to a build a leg here kind of signal the same way i showed you an eye and signal and so when you do this um when you do this uh you get uh uh you get the the kick start regeneration you've got some toes you've got a toenail uh the treatment so this is this is interesting because the treatment here is only one day and a one day treatment kickstarts 13 months of leg growth during which time you never touch the system again so it really is a very early trigger to intervene in the elect in the decision making of those cells which occurs apparently in in this case and at the electrical level and then downstream of that all of the things you need to actually build the leg get turned on so all the different gradients and everything else get turned on without any intervention on on on our part and so i've shown you data on frog and worm and and people sort of wonder whether this has anything to do with mammals i mean the reality is that uh evolution discovered this stuff back around the time of uh bacterial biofilms um so there's some great work uh now looking at electrical signaling in bacterial colonies and we've done a lot of this in human mesenchymal stem cells although in vitro it's not quite as exciting as in vivo uh what the phenotypes are but here i have to do a disclosure which is that we have a spin-off company called morphaceuticals inc where we're actually uh trying to take what we've done in frog which is to solve the leg regeneration uh problem in frog and turning a non-regenerative animal into a regenerative animal without any gene therapy or anything like that and uh trying to apply it to mammals so we have uh we are now um starting experiments in in rodents to uh drive what hopefully someday will be lim lim regeneration applications so uh we you know in in thinking about how the bioelectrics actually couples to downstream you know how do voltages talk to the genome on a single cell level we already know this so we know there are at least half a dozen mechanisms by which bioelectric change controls gene expression so of course there's calcium signaling which is familiar from neuroscience but there are also some other interesting uh interesting transduction methods so this is this is known and which genes are downstream is also known we have all kinds of candidate genes but also unbiased approaches like uh gene um ngs you know and rnac and so on that tell us what what the targets are so so so these these data on the single cell level are known but they're sort of profoundly unsatisfying in an important way because as i started out in the talk by saying that our goal is not to understand why a particular cell becomes a particular cell type our goal is to understand the determination of large-scale anatomy and so what we spend most of our time doing is making these uh sort of multi-scale models whereby within a single cell you simulate the various transcriptional and bioelectric circuits that exist and then you model this uh this the circuit in every cell of a large collective like a like a virtual planarian and then you can ask tissue level questions like when we cut it into pieces does this circuit rescale itself so does this kind of gradient reappear and these are very parallel questions to things that you might ask of reaction diffusion systems for like touring patterns and chemical morphogens and so on but actually uh and i don't have time to go into all the details but actually the bioelectric um circuits have some some really um nice properties with respect to the stability and so on uh compared to the the biochemical models and so we try to build from the from the gene regulatory networks to an understanding of the ion channel activity in single cells to tissue-wide dynamics and ultimately to the algorithms that we can use to control to infer what changes need to be made in order to uh get particular outcomes and the the cool part about this and so and so we've developed and again this is largely the work of alexis pytak our collaborator uh there's some software that you can download that are simulators for all this kind of thing so you can now um actually get this and play with it what's neat is that by making these simulations you can do virtual experiments and ask if they agree with uh with with results and they predict new experiments and ask you know how how various scenarios would play out but they are also uh quite amenable to machine learning approaches and so we've used both uh genetic algorithms and and other ways to identify this kind of needle in a haystack sort of uh experimental trigger or intervention that would work in a complicated system like this to get the particular outcome because because we are now starting to gain a rational understanding of these circuits so that we can we can search a more tractable space of possible intervention so that's how that's what we're hoping to get to medicine and so the example i want to show you just just mike one quick question you don't mind of course the market the question the chat box um he was wondering um there's a um if it's really electric or if it's really about chemistry for instance if you have um let's say if you would replace a manganese ions by calcium ions would you get similar results or is question chemistry specific great question yeah yeah we we did all this and and we and we we we do this in every every biologics paper that we publish it tends to have this experiment in there uh the answer is it really is voltage so you can in in every case that i know of except for one you can replace all of the the identity of the ion doesn't matter at all and the identity of the ion channel doesn't matter as long as you replace them with variants that give the same voltage outcome so you can do the exact same thing with chloride with potassium with uh uh with with sodium with protons and we use uh ion pumps from yeast in mammalian cells we use frog channels in uh in mammalian cells it doesn't matter you can you can swap these out the the genetics of it doesn't matter what matters is that you get the voltage right and so that's why these simulators are very important because they tell you uh the properties that you need to what is it about that channel that's actually important maybe it's the voltage sensitivity maybe it's the fact that it um has a particular rate of of activity and so on uh as long as you get as long as you get that right it's what the what the recipient cells are reading is the voltage not how you got there it's not it's not the chemistry of how you got there okay and there's actually another one very briefly by aidan doesn't this introduce gross conflict with a hayflick limit for cellular replication if not what prevents unlimited replication for instance in cancer yeah that's a that's a great question and we can talk about um we can talk about cancer we have all kinds of data on on cancer we've uh we've shown that you can both uh create or induce a a medici a full melanoma metastatic melanoma phenotype with no transgenes no genetic defects no carcinogens simply by uh disrupting the electrical communication between cells and you can do the opposite you can take really nasty oncogenes like hair ass mutations injected into into cells and and normalize them into being normal tissues by managing the downstream electrophysiology um i i don't know how this gets around the hayflick limit how do the planaria get around the hayflick limit um unclear i'm not sure that we understand the a flick limit uh well enough to answer this but you know most of the applications that i'm talking about here don't at this point don't don't address the aging problem so the you know if a cell is fundamentally damaged to the point where uh it just can't you know upkeep the various pathways there's nothing but bioelectricity isn't gonna help with that but planaria have the secret clearly and and uh you know we don't know how it works okay so um so this so so there's a story that uh that i'd like to show you which which goes beyond what i've shown you before and it has to do with this encoding metaphor so one thing that uh people often say is that uh the dna is the software of the cell and then the cell itself is the hardware that sort of re reads it out and at the level of protein structure that's that's that's that's a fair that's a fair analogy but i want to give you a different code metaphor at the for for anatomy because uh at the level of anatomy what happens is that the what the genome actually does is it sets your hardware the genome tells every cell what channels and pumps and gap junctions it's going to have so the genome is what determines the cellular hardware but the cool thing about these uh these these channels and gap junctions is that they are post translationally uh active meaning they can open and close once they're in place and that means that when you when you connect a bunch of these cells to get together into a into a tissue you get an excitable medium much like in the neural network you can get propagation of action potentials and computation without changes in transcription meaning just with the standard hodgkin-huxley neurons that are there um channels that are there you can and this is this this particular thing here is just a simulation you can have cells that are uh identical in transcriptome identical and proteome uh and all of the interesting pattern so symmetry breaking spontaneous all the things you would see in with turing patterns and so on all of this stuff can ride on the physics just like in the nervous system it does not require uh transcriptional changes to drive it although of course downstream there will be um transcriptional changes and so this uh and so and so this has interesting implications that uh are are parallel to things we see in for example simple flip-flop circuits which are very simple memory elements that can store an electrical state but they can be flipped between one state and another that is stable in between uh stimuli you don't have to keep stimulating them they simply hold state so you can easily show how memory circuits much like in the brain can form in these tissues and so this makes an interesting prediction it predicts that we should be able to edit this the software while while actually keeping the hardware constant by not having to swap out channels and pumps so i'm going to show you a quick example of this so here are two planaria here is a planarian with one head and one tail there's a planarian with one head and one tail if you ask where the molecular markers are so the head marker is in the anterior where it should be there's no head marker in the tail same thing over here and when i cut this one i get a one headed worm when i cut this one i get a two headed worm now why would that be well of course it's because in the meantime what we did before cutting is we induced we took this normal bioelectric pattern that says head on this end no head on that end and we duplicated it now you can see it's a little messy the technology is still being worked out but we can clearly set both ends to be uh head like and then you get this you get this two-headed form but here's the really important part to notice this bioelectric pattern is is from this animal not from this animal it is from the one-headed form in other words the bioelectric pattern is not a readout or a reflection of what the anatomy is right now much like that flip-flop that i showed you where the same hardware can store one of two pieces of information depending on which way the the the current is flowing this stable electric circuit can can hold at least two probably more but at least two that we know of possible electrical uh stable states that will sit there and basically do nothing they're like a latent memory until you injure the animal and when you injure the animal that is when this pattern becomes relevant because then the cells will follow and basically build to the information that's here so at that point after injury the cells will then build these uh a two-headed worm so very important to realize that this bioelectrical pattern does not reflect the current anatomy it reflects information that will guide towards a future anatomy so for people interested in basal cognition and the question of where did the nervous system get this amazing trick of being able to represent counter factual memories so being able to hold information states that are not the results of the current input that you're getting right now but of things that happened before or even entertain uh patterns about things that should happen later this uh i think is uh is a very simple evolutionarily it's a very basal form of this where the tissue can store one of two representations of what a correct planarian looks like and that representation guides the guides the anatomy so when we think about this two-headed worm so i've called it a pattern memory um let's let's just test this idea so so when you know what happens when you cut one of these two-headed worms so we're going to get rid of the normal head we're going to get rid of the ectopic secondary head that might serve as an organizer people say well it's epigenetically reprogrammed those cells fine we get rid of them we keep the nice normal middle gut fragment which has normal genetics and we cut it in plain water no more drugs you know no no more manipulations of any kind and so the standard paradigms as well once you're once you've gotten rid of this of course you should get a normal worm and so um we didn't know this at the time when we first did this experiment but now we actually know that if you plot the uh the landscape of the circuit that that guides this there's actually a really nice stable attractor down here uh at the two-headed state and amazingly when you cut them that's in fact exactly what you see so when you cut these animals even though they're genetically identical to these animals they in perpetuity remain two-headed so all of these fragments continue to make two-headed animals now uh some years after that we learned to set it back so now this is a true toggle at this point we can go from one headed to two-headed and each and and and the reason i call this a memory is because it has the major properties of memory so it's long-term stable it is labile meaning you can rewrite it if you know how to manipulate the circuit it has conditional recall meaning it often doesn't do anything until you actually injure the animal and so on so one a standard planarian body can hold at least one of two different uh representations of how to build a correct planarian and when to stop and so what we're doing now is uh we are basically trying to build models of these electrical circuits that are a merger of two approaches on the one hand dynamical systems where we treat these things as attractors in the state space and so on on the one hand and on the other hand uh the kinds of tools that people use in artificial neural networks to identify specific memories with stable states in the attractor space of the network and so there's um santosh monica is a postdoc in the group wrote a nice review trying to uh trying to show how these two approaches the sort of um artificial neural network approach and the dynamical systems theory approach actually map together quite nicely and they're sort of two two faces of the same coin so um as i'm running out of time i just want to show you two very quick uh two very quick things at the end uh what i think is the future of all this so one of the most important aspects of this is that with the bioelectricity whereas we started 20 years ago we started in a uh at a place where it really wasn't even clear that that voltage gradients had any role besides housekeeping we are now to the point where we can make computational models that are that allow uh predictive and rational changes of outcome so this is not about making random changes to see what happens that's what we were doing in around the year 2000 or so at this point we can do things like this so so if you ask why is the frog brain misshapen under various teratogens so here's a normal tadpole brain here's a brain where the notch gene has been mutated uh there's a there's a dominant mutation that's been introduced into this animal where the forebrain is basically missing the high net midbrains are bubbles for all intents and purposes there's no behavior they don't move they don't learn what we could do is build a model of the early neural tube and the electrical pre-pattern that tells the brain how big and what shape it should be and then we make the model of what happens to the bioelectrics under these various interventions and we're talking alcohol nicotine mutations whatever and then we can ask this model a simple question what channels would we have to open and close to get back to the correct pre pattern and this is just one example from uh from from work here by vipai in my group also with with alexis where what we did was we built this model and we asked the model how would you get back to normal from this disease state and the model suggested a particular ion channel that can be opened with an existing human approved drug and when you do that you take an intervention such as a mutation such as a mutation or uh or exposure to really potent heritage and for a large number of the of the animals you can actually uh read normalize them such that the brain becomes you can see here the anatomy of the brain becomes normal the gene expression becomes normal and they get their iqs back their learning rate is back to that of normal animals so the idea here is that by building these computational models that link uh that that show you what the dynamics of the circuit and you need the models because these things are not obvious you can't just look at these electrical networks and know what to do to get a particular pattern there's too much um non-linearity here so but but the models are are are a good way forward and so what we're hoping to do is to establish a uh a platform that will take uh the data on which channels are present so so uh profiling data from from the literature and and the databases knowledge of what bioelectric state is required what do you want what's the what's the health state compared to the disease state that you have and then the simulation will basically help you design a cocktail of appropriate openers and blockers that are computationally predicted to shift the complex bioelectric pattern not a single cell state but a complex uh spatial pattern to one that's more correct and so this is something we're working on with with jack tyzinski um and you can play with it here at the server i think is is up right now where uh you can actually look up various various tissues the various channels they express and use this with with your simulator of choice to try to design uh drug intervention so this is all meant to be um you know what what i'm trying to show you is is a journey from very basic questions about how uh tissues might represent uh anatomical gold states and a very specific mechanistic hypothesis about where that might be and then quantitative data that uh that takes that hypothesis and tries to um basically validate it by by therapeutics so uh what what i've to summarize what i've tried to tell you is that um there's this really interesting uh computational layer that sits between the genotype and the anatomy that uh makes a lot of important decisions that control downstream events and that this is a really uh key target i think for for for biomedicine i think evolution discovered this very early on that electrical signaling is convenient medium for computation uh i we we've argued elsewhere uh that basically a lot of the tricks that you see in the nervous system and in the brain are sped up elaborations of of things that evolution discovered very early on so this this uh developmental bioelectrics eventually evolved from solving problems in morphospace anatomical remodeling to solving very similar problems in three-dimensional space for behavior meaning control of animal animal movement and and there's lots of interesting things to talk about there um so so we're now to the point where we have started to just started to crack this by lecture code to rewrite these patterns that control the large scale behavior of cellular collectives so this is uh this is something that in other areas that we work on with roboticists and and engineers this is this goes under collective intelligence it's basically trying to understand how cell groups not individual cells but cell groups can can can implement this kind of anatomical homeostasis loop and we are trying to develop these ai tools that are going to help us gain control of these things and of course this will feed back in both directions because i think that once we understand how somatic tissues compute under novel conditions such as teratogenesis such as the the picasso tadpoles and so on we can take some of those lessons back to making better machine learning platforms that are not based on specifically neural architectures but on far older ways that biology was solving problems so i want to thank uh the people i'm here here's everybody i've shown you a lot of work so here all the all the students uh postdocs and uh and collaborators that have worked with us i want to uh thank our our funders the paul g allen frontiers group um and and you know various other foundations that have that have supported us again there's a there's a disclosure and i just want to i just want to end by uh showing you a video of these two-headed worms uh because it's important you know the first time i i discussed this phenotype um at a conference somebody stood up and said that these animals can't exist and so i just want to show you a video of them so you can see that they in fact do exist and these are the progeny of the two-headed worms that have been cut for many generations in plain water there's there's no other no other treatment and the memory is in fact quite um quite robust so um i thank you and i'll take questions thank you so much thank you so much mike for this fascinating and interesting talk you spend so many interesting topics it's really a buffet of of fascinating stuff and uh and there also um quite a lot of questions already on the chat box um so maybe i combine actually uh two of the questions so one was about the information time scale over which the information is stored electrical patterns so it was a long time scale i suppose and on the other hand there's a question about about the microscopic details this is a gap junctions and and so on and say um channels have very different and important resting potentials so if these microscopic details are really important as well on the other scale and how these different scales are actually combined it sounds like a really challenging problem yeah yeah great great great question yeah and it is a challenging problem so i can i can tell you a couple of things although there's way more questions than there are answers so one issue is about the time the the time dimension here so uh some of these circuits like the ones in the planaria uh once you make a particular change in the bioelectrics the circuit has this memory property it basically holds so then and and that hold can be it can be as far as we can tell you know a really really long time um now there are other mechanisms of course that take over downstream and so one of the things for example that we've seen is that uh in the short term much like in the brain we have short-term memory that's basically electrical but then the long-term memory tends to be other things uh the same thing happens in these other tissues so there are cytoskeletal rearrangements and other types of uh non-bioelectric changes that uh that sort of catalyze the short-term electrical properties so there are both long-term electrical memory and non-electrical aspects like tissue polarity like cytoskeletal structure and so on that um that are downstream with respect to the spatial scale the important thing about the bi-electrocode is that is it is not a cell level phenomenon so what matters is not the voltage of any one cell what matters is the the difference between a group of cells in the neighboring group of cells and the spatial distribution in which those voltages occur so most of the time changing any one cell so the details at the single cell level usually don't matter if you're going to make a change you need to affect a minimum number of cells and in particular it's no good to um raise the whole the whole tissue up or down in terms of voltage that usually doesn't do anything what you need to do is to do this and establish boundaries so compartment boundaries where the voltage is different across two two neighboring cells that's where all the action is but but again it tends to be large groups i think the minimal if i had to guess what the minimum size is and this is partially our work and partially um adam cohen at harvard the minimum size is something like 50 cells before you know before anything too interesting is going to happen okay yeah go ahead mustafa uh mike i mean that was truly fascinating always listening to you thank you um now at the end of your talk you mentioned you're mapping out all the ion channels in all the tissues and you're going to come up with sort of um electrosurgical cocktails to to treat disease or iron channel dysfunction something like that i'm like how do you see avoiding kind of cross reactivity because the ion channels the thing about iron channels is they're everywhere in the body everywhere every section just general idea sure sure yeah no abs absolutely i'm so so a couple of things i'll say so so first we are certainly not mapping the channels so other people are doing that right and i'm we're just taking data data from others okay so so the cross reactivity is is really important there are two two pieces to this one piece is spatial so if i want to control the voltage in one particular region and i'm telling you that i think you're going to be taking a systemic drug that's going to go everywhere right how are you going to have spatial specificity so the way that um uh the way that we've we've been using it in uh in our animal models because remember that in in the examples that i've shown you especially with the fixing of the brain structure which is quite spatially specific right you need to get exactly the right size of the neural tube you can't just screw up all the you know voltages everywhere uh those animals were just soaked in the drug they were just soaked there was no spatial and the reason it works is because you can ask the model a very specific question given where the different channels are expressed and what their properties are in terms of who's going to open and close at different voltages what is a combination of drugs that's going to be specific for a particular outcome now in some cases the answer may be there is no such solution right so i'm not claiming that this is going to handle everything and it's certainly not going to handle uh cases where heck you know you're missing some enzyme or something that's just you know this is not going to fix it but um but but there's a wide class of problems where you can come up with a stimulation that because of the properties of the you know for example what happens in the brain in the in the frog brain case is uh these drugs uh the the voltages that are inc that are already correct they have no effect in those regions because what the drug actually does is increase contrast so cells that are that are um a little bit uh hyperpolarized it makes it more hyper polarized cells that are not stay down and in the end you you basically just sharpen the borders what it ends up it's like a contrast enhancer basically robert if you'll forgive me i just want to do a little plug and mike is too modest to mention but the two of us edit this wonderful journal called by electricity i just wanted to make people aware do submit thanks yeah a little bit of advertisement very good very good thanks mr very good hey um mike's there was a question by chovani and i think um he's part of the ellen discovery center i said right so he asked to which extent is a bioelectric state inheritable it sounds very interesting if you take one of those swarms that develop a head like an um like another species and you go to the next generation do you get the same head yeah this is this is a very good question um so i can say this uh we don't have any evidence yet that uh that this is heritable past the traditional uh sperm and egg mode of reproduction okay so we don't have any evidence for that um actually getting them to reproduce sexually is really not easy we haven't gotten it to work yet um and i don't really have any reason to predict that that would happen however what's cool about the planaria is that their normal reproductive mode is fission they normally at least this species normally tears themse itself in half and now you've got two worms right that's how they reproduce so that method of reproduction conserves uh the new phenotype so when they do that it does propagate so you could imagine throwing these worms in the here over the over here in the charles river and a hundred years from now some some scientists will come along they'll scoop up some worms they'll say oh a single-headed form in a double-headed form that's cool a speciation event and then of course you sequence the genome and guess what the genome is exactly the same so uh i don't know if it will go past sperm and agree production that remains to be seen so what is the question by jordan do you want to ask yourself jordan hi there michael thank you for an amazing talk thank you so much um so i had i had a few questions um which were related when you were inducing the frog leg to regrow you made a single intervention so um does this the electro the electrical pattern um change over time during them redevelopment and so would you expect that making multiple interventions could help regrowth and then my final question was how precise do you have to be to trigger a leg versus an arm yeah yeah great great great question uh i'll i'll take the second question first the the precision of it so uh one of the one of the things that we have that's that's easier to do is to uh to to catch these trigger signals that basically say build whatever normally goes here that's the easier version so the easiest thing to do is to use the exact same intervention that triggers a leg at the end of a stump or a tail on the table and it's the same intervention you don't micromanage it you so you say whatever normally goes here go ahead and build it there are already this the system of course did it during embryonic development so of course they already have all the information that's needed that's the easiest the stuff that i showed you where you can actually change the the the the shape of what's what's forming and i haven't shown you we have data on size control and other things that's much harder and so uh we're working on it and that's really going to be the future of cracking the bioelectric code is to say i don't want a regular arm you know i want an arm with this many fingers or what it like that that's that's where we're going and we can sort of do that in planaria we can do some of that in frog it's that's basically the future right but for now what's amazing is that uh we can trigger these simple uh kickstart the native uh the native morphogenetic cascade and those those those seem to work fine and those are those seem to be easier to to trigger brilliant so it's sort of spatially already pre-programmed you know in a sense yeah i think those are just used to be here yeah those seem to be easier to access i mean look where this this whole process to me is is reverse engineering right we're we're given this amazing thing and we're trying to reverse engineer it and i think the first thing we found is that it is incredibly modular and that yes you can dig into those modules and change how they work but the easier thing is to just make the subroutine calls and just say hey you know here's here's where you do this that seems to be how the architecture the native architecture works brilliant thank you thank you i think there are a few more questions on the chat box do you want to ask directly mark for instance or anyone yes sorry can you hear me sure so i have two questions the first is if you apply a better cut rna and depolarization and the at the same time what what privileges so do you from the head or or the tail and my second question regarding the comment you said just uh you get two phenotypes in a hundred years what happens to the head and the tails so you just get the the part in the middle the head and the tail do they reform the bi-headed or do they get not normal morphology because normally fission is just cuts in the middle not you not in three parts right correct correct so um so there's a couple of subtleties here uh if you uh the the fission actually is is not usually exactly in the middle it can be in a couple of different locations and what normally happens in the typical fission is that you get one double-headed animal and one single-headed animal that's that's what typically happens i should point out um something that i only talked about one phenotype which are these two-headed animals there's actually a much more interesting uh i think phenotype that we've we've described that that i didn't talk about today which is something we call cryptic worms what cryptic worms are are animals that have a permanent so they're basically uh i i think the way we think about them is they're sort of um stuck on this bifurcation saddle point where they stochastically choose one head or two heads at each cut they're destabilized they don't they don't really know um how many heads they're supposed to have in fact we just published a paper looking at uh comparing this to actually by stable perceptions in the visual system you know like neckercube those kind of illusions where the same network can fall very easily it's sort of balanced between one of two interpretations so the thing with these uh cryptic worms is that every piece of a cryptic worm gives rise to cryptic worms and uh and in fact two pieces that are sitting right next to each other have independent future outcomes in other words each piece makes its own independent stochastic decision and that and that happens with with every piece um the uh what was the first question oh the beta cat so right so so so here's the thing uh when when you do this so so so the the beta cat and the various genes that are that that are important for building heads and tails are downstream of the bioelectric machinery so if you perturb the implementation machinery such that uh the no amount of bioelectrics is going to be able to make a head if you don't have the genes that are necessary to to to make a head so when you when you block things downstream you're going to prevent it what's interesting and we've done you can um sort of email me afterwards and we could i can take you through a lot of the data um when you when you uh start to wrestle with start to compare those two pathways directly one of the interesting things that you see is that when you for example induce ectopic heads with beta cat they're often uh they're often not scaled correctly in other words you got the tissue identity right but but but you didn't get the size control they're sort of and then we have we have pictures of this in when the last paper they're they're they kind of a funny scale when you do the bioelectrics you catch all the downstream stuff because it is a it is a higher level signal so they're properly scaled they're you know they get the correct head size and and all of that so there's some there's some interesting kind of cross um comparisons to be made i think i think it's a great question thank you very much thank you maybe one last question cyborg i had a question do you wanna just ask it yourself okay i i lost my unmute button i haven't really used teams before um yes my question was is it possible to um bioelectrically reset either individual cells or small fractions of the planaria that there was a question earlier about the heritability of these bioelectric states and it seems that um or at least it seems plausible to me that if it's difficult to get the planaria to reproduce that maybe an alternative way of assessing that would be to um perturb the bioelectric state somehow then reset some small fraction and and see if um that uh small fraction can still grow into the organism with the two heads or a head from a different species or something yeah so you can certainly um we can certainly reset them back to normal so we can take a two-headed worm and and cut pieces and reset those pieces back to a normal pattern and then you're back to a normal wild-type worm that will continue to make normal worms so you can certainly reset it so so that kind of uh that the that aspect of the memory holds uh for very long periods of time and and it's certainly um stable across fission and across cutting and those kinds of things i just don't know what happens when you have that that bottleneck where everything comes down to one cell the egg and then and then develops again i can i can sort of imagine how it might work but we don't have any evidence that that's what happens sure thank you okay very good uh maybe in the interest of time i think um maybe it's a good time to stop here um i wanted to say thank you again to mike for taking so much time and explaining and giving such a fantastic inspiring talk and to everyone for attending and it's a fantastic community i think we're having here so thank you again and see you all soon thank you all so much
