please welcome to the stage Douglas rushkoff [Applause] hey well thanks for coming gosh that means a lot to me I haven't been in Austin in a while not since the last.com crash um it's funny I was at a party of rich people um just a week a week and a half ago and I was not one of the rich people they bring me really as the entertainment I'm kind of like a um the intellectuals version of the dominatrix for rich people right they invite one sort of a narco Marxist there to just rib them and tweak them you know thank you Doug may I please have another you know evil capitalists it's like oh good tell me why I'm red you know you tell me why my company is going to extract all the value out of the world right and I met this this one dude who had just he was all excited because he had just finished raising 250 million dollars for a venture fund right which is not a hedge fund it turns out he was very upset when I was like a hedge fund no it's not a hedge fund it's Venture fund because it's not public um it's like this other kind of thing so he had 250 million dollars I'm like man you raised 250 million dollars just out of curiosity when you raise 250 million dollars like where do you keep it before you invest it in these companies and he goes oh we got a special place for that called Silicon Valley Bank it's the first I hadn't heard of the place before so now I looked and you know they crashed right but it's still only 250 000 of the money is guaranteed so we'll see but it sounds like there's what 249 million seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars for now is gone unless the government decides to come in and help them you know and and I didn't have a good I mean I just nodded when when they said Silicon Valley Bank because usually what I like to do is tweak wealthy people I mean I guess I kind of am an intellectual dominatrix when they say really ridiculous things I kind of challenge them to see whether they can unwind what they've just said or if they just double down on the stupidity right and I mean that's the kind of thing that's the thing that got me you know famous most recently was I I was invited I thought to do this talk for a bunch of wealthy people on the future of the digital economy and it turned out that instead of bringing me out to the to the stage to do something these five dudes came into the green room and sat around this table and started peppering me with all of those really you know binary questions that you don't ask someone like me I mean they were like you know a Bitcoin or ethereum right or or augmented reality or virtual reality like which one should they bet on it's like I'm a media theorist but I'm wrong about those things I was like I would have said betamax right or CompuServe right I mean I was right but wrong right I mean I was right in the sense I knew what was happening but don't don't look at me to place your bets but they were doing all that and then finally they got around to the question Alaska or New Zealand right where should they put their bunkers right so here's these five billionaires or four billionaires and one almost billionaire Tech bro dude who are asking a narco-syndicalist Marxist media theorist right ex-theater director Jew from New York where to put their friggin bunkers for the event right the electromagnetic pulse or pandemic or climate catastrophe or or revolution that that leads to the end of the world as we know it and forces them to retreat to a uh to their dream home um and again because this is the way I am so I kind of tweaked them I'm like okay so you've got your bunker in New Zealand or in Alaska right then what about the rest of us they're like well what about everybody who comes and then wants your food and shelters oh we've got Navy Seals for that you know they're already standing by their helicopters are fully gassed you know one push speed dial button they're activated they come they go and they meet us at the compound it's like oh you got Navy Seals so again the tweaker um I'm like so how are you gonna pay these people after your money is worthless and they kind of stop like they never even thought of this they don't even watch Walking Dead or something's like what are you thinking right one of them he opens his little moleskin book and he's like how to pay security after the like he's gonna ask his financial advisor or something right and we get on this long conversation when that's where they start saying well you know uh I'll be the only one who knows the combination to the safe where we keep the food it's like oh Navy Seals have never had to try to get information out of anybody before you know you're going to spend your apocalypse being waterboarded right and then someone else is like oh we're gonna have little you know little implants that are going to control where people can go in the facility and we could always use them as kind of like impromptu shock collars if they get out of hand it's like oh Navy Seals are going to respond really well to that you know and don't worry Army Rangers won't respond well to that either right so they they double down you see what they do they double down they can't they can't kind of unwind their thinking they just want to go you know further into it further with there's another fix on top of that or a shock collar or this or that and what I what I realized speaking to these guys is and it sounds odd but I don't believe they're building their bunkers or fantasizing about their bunkers because they're afraid of some bad thing that's going to happen I think the bad stuff in the world that might happen is there excuse for investing in their fantasy of this crazy isolated bizarre life above and apart from the rest of us you know it's like Gomez Adams and the millionaires of that era they had those train sets that they would build right what for these guys this is their train set their bunker their their apocalypse place with the heated pools I remember one guy was showing me the plans with the heated pools and I'm like I know this person in our neighborhood that has a heated pool you know there's a truck in front of his house all summer from the company bringing the new filter and the new heater and the new this I'm like where are you going to get the parts for your heated pool after the apocalypse are you 3D printing this stuff again that moleskin book parts for you did pool right and I I've spent most of my career blaming capitalism for this right which we could do those of us who are here at South by even in the early 90s the the pre uh wired internet of the late 80s and early 90s we know what the internet was for what this was supposed to be about right the the wild uh possibilities of the unbridled Collective human imagination right the point of the net originally was we were gonna [ __ ] things up right it was going to be a new unpredictable crazy future world this is why they had to hire psychedelics users to program the early computers because psychedelics people were the only ones who were comfortable hallucinating a new reality and it's true I knew these people they would work at Intel during the day and come home to the Oakland at night and scrape the Peyote buds off the cactuses and trip their balls off at night and then you know have a sun workstation at home and make fractals that would then get projected at a rave that's who we were right then Along Came at least in the narrative As I understood it Along Came Wired Magazine right and recontextualized this digital Renaissance as a revolution for the NASDAQ Stock Exchange that thanks to digital technology the stock market the NASDAQ Stock Exchange will grow exponentially uninterrupted forever that was called The Long boom and even Alan Greenspan chairman of the Federal Reserve believed this right he said we're in a new paradigm this is going to keep going forever but it really wasn't just that you know it's it's also that there was and I I didn't want to really believe this but there is something intrinsic to the tech mindset that somehow yearns for this kind of disconnection as well not all of us but there's a tendency and and I I remember it was around of God 89 or 1990 I was at Timothy Leary's house for those of you don't know he was a great counterculture figure psychedelic dude um I was at his house when he was reading Stuart Brand's book on Nicholas negroponte's media lab you know the media lab at MIT where all this digital stuff was happening and he's reading this book with these felt tip pens and circling all this stuff and I'm thinking oh my gosh this is great Tim is on board the digital Revolution this is going to be wonderful he's reading this thing reading his thing and by the end of the afternoon he slams the book and he throws it across the room and he goes blah like he's vomiting it up Tim what what and he goes first less than three percent of the names in the index of this book are women right and this is like 1991 or 1990. that was early to make that kind of observation he goes you know it's going to be [ __ ] up if there's less than three percent women and he said the second thing is what these guys are actually trying to do is recreate the womb with digital technology he said uh their their mothers were probably unable to anticipate their every need when they were babies and now they want to build a digital womb that will know what they want before they know they want it and bring it to them you know they they will be kind of disconnected and the Apocalypse is just the excuse for them to build that that's what I'm realizing it's the excuse for the dream to be realized because these guys they want to go meta on reality that's their job the bunker the is the ultimate exit strategy right you don't just exit your business you exit from this from the people right what did what was Peter Thiel doing yesterday or the day before when he called his companies when they when he when he texted whatever and said hey guys pull out of that bank we're going let's watch everybody else implode right as long as you've got a fast enough algorithm or a fast enough Ultra fast trading mechanisms to get out of that bank before everybody else push the trigger first right but that was that's Peter thiel's whole philosophy right what's his book remember his book it's called from zero to one what does that mean go from zero to one it means you should and he says this you need your business to operate one order of magnitude above everybody else they're all competing down here on the ground you have the transformative idea that lets you rise an order of magnitude zero to one or one to ten or ten to a hundred above the others that's what web 2 was about remember Tim O'Reilly and web 2 oh you've go you got your.com companies all the.com companies compete what you want to do is not be a web one company competing down there on the ground but aggregate so if there's all these travel sites you become the aggregator of travel sites one level above that that's Web Two you've gone meta on web one but what happens when there's a bunch of different aggregation sites well then I guess you become an aggregator of aggregators and an aggregator of aggregator of aggregators right you keep going meta that's what Zuckerberg's doing Zuckerberg was the the ultimate web 2 company the one that that teal loved right everybody's competing for status and all that so we're going to create the site that lets everyone compete for status and form scapegoats and do whatever they do and now what does Mark Zuckerberg do once like Sheryl sandborg jumps ship and the Congress is all mad at him and nobody really likes it I don't believe this is not fun anymore right I'm going that uh literally meta and what's meta for him I'm going to take a bunch of technologies that nobody really knows what they are right say crypto and VR and web3 and just and and make it throw them in a basket and Ai and call it meta right because it's it's whatever it is it's meta and I declare it I declare one one level above you all or Kurzweil the ultimate digital dream right I'm going to rise from the Chrysalis of matter as pure Consciousness right or Sam Altman just to upload to the [ __ ] cloud pure meta right that's the pure digital dream it's not even that the traditional one right of of living in a cubicle being serviced by you know strange sex robots you're not even in the body I mean that first image of of Zuckerberg's web three that was the accurate one right nothing below the waist please nothing below the waist that's the dream all right I'll put legs on the [ __ ] thing if I have to right we meant that we were going to put legs on there all along no they weren't it's going to keep going up until it's just here right but this is this is what we are what we're looking at you know so I I blamed capitalism and then I see it oh no no it's digital and the Way digital and symbol systems and all goes meta then I'm like no it's actually the problem here is the way these two worlds these two languages these two mindsets dovetail together right digital and finance were made for each other right what is digital digital is a symbol system right digital is not real it can feel real it's not real what's an MP3 It's a bunch of numbers and codes that when played back can imitate The Sound of Music right it's almost more a metaphor for music than it is meta than it is music I mean listen to real Music Live In A Thing listen to an MP3 right it's stimulating your little ear holes so that that's like music but it's not music right it's not hang on the bass speaker at a [ __ ] concert and you'll you'll know what music is that stuff that's coming that's moving the wind in the room that's music it's something else but digital is those symbol systems right what is finance Finance is meta business right I might be transacting with someone I'm gonna buy a chicken from you and you're gonna buy a uh some shoes from me caesar right he's gonna he's gonna we're gonna that's a transaction what is finance Finance is someone else going those two people are transacting how can I make money off that how can I own the game right so I'm going to invent Central currency so if you want to buy a chicken from Caesar you're going to have to borrow money from me and then use that money to to buy the chicken from him but you're gonna have to pay me back money for that but that's what central currency was about you're going to loan money into existence you're going to get back more than you loan that was great for colonialism it was great for the expansion of the economy because it has to grow in order to pay back the bank but what is it it's financialization or stock right even if you have stock in a real company what has the stock really owned by now it's by owned by the derivatives right there's a there's there's a company that's creating value there's stock you can have in that company there's derivatives you can have of the stock right which is that stock theoretically three months in the future then there's derivatives you can buy of the derivatives and derivatives of those derivatives and credit to fault swaps if the derivatives don't work and the derivatives don't work in the derivatives don't worry it doesn't work right but the derivatives Exchange in a digital Marketplace because digital loves abstraction right digital doesn't need the real world digital is great at derivatives and derivatives and derivatives and derivatives derivatives right oh it's all there it's part of that world It's All abstracted Digital lets us do an infinity of derivative synthetic instruments on top of the economy because the derivatives exchanges were so Amplified and magnified by digital technology in 2013 the New York Stock Exchange which was already an abstraction of the real Market which is in a sense an abstraction of human need it was consumed by the derivatives Exchange the itex derivatives exchange bought the New York Stock Exchange right so this abstraction was consumed by its own abstraction that's what happens in digital we get further and further away from terrafirma from actual people from what's actually happening here and that's been I would argue kind of the purpose of this of this way of thinking of this mindset and I've been trying to figure out where the heck did it come from and there's a few places you can look at on where this kind of anti-human rise above the humans abstract yourself from the human's mindset this way of understanding the world comes from you can look at scientism for that I don't mean real science I mean the scientism what what Francis Bacon was talking about when he was arguing for implementing empirical science in the Renaissance do you know what he said when he was selling empirical science as a new way of of thinking about the world he said science will let us take Nature by the forelock hold her down and submit her to our will knew what the forelock is hair right we're going to take Nature by the hair hold her down right he picked the pronoun he picked a specific pronoun hold her down and submit her to our will so science for bacon and the Royal Academy of scientists at that time was a rape fantasy we're gonna take nature hold her [ __ ] down make her do what we say why because Nature's scary and soiled and fairies and worms and darkness and forests and moons and unpredictability right nature is like the early internet all that weird-ass Gaia crazy Grateful Dead psychedelic mushroom fractal stuff right it's more like a fantasy role-playing game than a good Aristotelian movie right keeps going that's the scary thing it keeps going it keeps going keeps going that was the funny thing and that and I haven't told people this one when I was with those crazy billionaires um I remember I told them uh the way to make sure their security Force doesn't kill them in the bunker I said why don't you pay for your head of Securities daughters bot Mitzvah today and it's Oh you mean like be nice to the security people and then maybe now they won't kill us then yeah be nice to them maybe their families yeah yeah it makes sense to them and their families maybe some of their families friends you know that makes sense too and then one of the guys said yeah but where does it stop where does it stop oh my God you mean you might have to be nice to everybody huh well I didn't why was I earning all this money in the first place right but it's that you got to get away you got to get away from the humans I mean that's the history of the way we understand labor right now certainly in a digital age how do you know if you have a successful business plan doesn't need people no employees right it can scale infinitely through algorithms you don't need all those [ __ ] workers all those people where did that come from that's his oldest technology that's as old as industrialism when we were in school we were taught the assembly line and machine processes and factories that was all to make more Goods right more Goods more efficiently it's not what the assembly line was for the assembly line was there so that you wouldn't have to hire competent workers right people used to exchange and trade the value they made if you were a competent Shoemaker you made shoes you went to the market and you sold the value that you created once you had chartered monopolies meaning you were the only one who could do business in a particular sector and you're going to go hire people to work in your shoe company are you going to hire skilled craft people no you're going to go to the medieval equivalent of the Home Depot parking lot and find unregistered aliens bring them in train them in 15 minutes how to put one nail into the bottom of the shoe and pass it to the next person so the assembly line itself holds the knowledge of shoemaking but each individual worker is oblivious to it and should be because if they know if they have skills then they can demand more money right then they can set the terms no you want them utterly replaceable so that was the beginning but we still think of workers that way at least under digital industrialism we still think of workers that way and we still think of humans that way right what we did was we reversed the polarity of Technology from the early Fringe wear you all remember fringeware Austin the Austin people the early fringeware Mondo 2000 boing boing understanding of Technology was that it was empowering people right people were going to use technology to create new unpredictable wild creative things but once you're betting on technology with capital do you want wild unpredictable things to happen no you want the most predictable things of all to happen you want your bets to work out so we reversed instead of people using technology to make things happen we use technology on people to make them more predictable to control them human beings are the problem and technology is the solution right are you solving for people no we're solving for business right we used social media I mean we tried boy they tried they had a good decade we're going to use social media the way like Bateson and Mead really would have would have uh understood Humanity as some Servo control mechanism we're going to use social media to control all these humans and they tried boy they tried they took the Las Vegas slot machines and stick them in the algorithms and did all that social dilemma kind of stuff but the odd thing about the social dilemma is none of it's actually true it didn't work right they couldn't control us so what are they going to do instead us right that's what AI is for it's funny I think of social media was like the missionaries do you ever see that movie The Mission by Roland job is a great movie the missionaries right the Catholic church and the and the Royals they sent the missionaries to America and South America First and what did the missionaries do they converted a lot of the indigenous people took Catholicism but what they also did was they studied the people what are their Customs how did they think and they sent all this information back to their home countries Back To The King who came next conquistadors right there were conquistadors using all the using the fact that people have been trained to like this culture and to speak the language and to believe in their gods then you send the Conquistadors who have all that intelligence and they conquer the people really fast social media was like the missionaries right oh this is fun it's all fine it's social they're going to learn all about you and how to cater to you and all our little algorithms and all and then and now we're here the AIS are here who know how to use every piece of information that social media that we gave to social media to now boy this is going to be interesting I was at one of those uh you know food Camp those things I was at a food Camp which are fun it's these friends of O'Reilly Gatherings where and you're not allowed to share what gets said there like by name but there's what do they call Charnel house Charter House Rules Chatham house there's a thing Charnel house is something else I think I swear you you get meat I think right Chatham House yeah so these rules but you're allowed to share so there was a guy who was the head of one of the the social media apps on your phone right now um and he came to me and he said Doug you know you've written a bunch of like medium posts that are kind of really negative on uh uh AI aren't you scared that when ai's in charge they're going to see what you wrote and come after you it's like I really hadn't thought about it and he says oh dude you know I don't say anything at all on any social network or anything about AI so they won't know and I'm like if the AIS are so smart right aren't they going to be able to infer from your selective removal of anything about AI from your feed how you feel about them he goes oh [ __ ] right it's that thing it's it's so fun to tweak these people right because they're so much smarter than us on the one hand but so dumb on the other it's partly because they get plucked from college when they're like 19 years old right to go become founders of things and it's like they didn't take history ethics philosophy it's like transfer parental Authority onto a freaking VC and what do you think you're going to get right so what what I'm trying to do rather than gloat which is still fun um rather than gloat at the impending Fiasco that we're about to witness and it's funny every time I come I came here in March of 2000 a similar moment um these they keep having I came here right right before the mortgage crisis or right during it and now now um this is an interesting moment for those of you who don't know this big bank there's a lot of stuff tied up in the ripple effect it's interesting and this thing that happened at the Big Bang partly happened because of bad communication they really and greed and I mean we can talk about that we can do our our postmortem when it's actually mortimed but um boy the bank communicated to its shareholders what they were doing to shore up its balance sheet and they didn't think about all those customers and they didn't realize that that Twitter is much faster than Edgar and CNBC at communicating what your company is doing all you need is one tweet from it Peter Thiel saying uh look what they just they just raising money I wonder why let's be on the safe side that's enough that's enough but anyway I don't want to gloat because I've already had I have two friends with companies who've had to lay off workers already because their payroll is not gonna they're gonna be able to download their payroll so real humans are suffering real human uh real human workers are having immediate effects from this kind of thing it trickles down really fast to to you and me of all things that trickle down it's never the money right it's it's this part but what I'm looking at is is how to engender the kind of change we need how can we kind of change the register from extractive digital industrialism to something much more uh Mutual or communitarian or fun I'm not necessarily psychedelic but but more loving more caring what what can we do to move from this Panic of the billionaire mindset which I think is finally dying its appropriate death to something else and it's always important and I want us all of us who I know a lot of you are on the side of social good and all that I want to to implore us all to stop using the language how do we get people to blank how do we get people to give more money how do we get people to start companies how do we get people to think like once you're in the how do we get people to right then you're doing things to people then you're back in the manipulating people even if it's like oh what memes could we put out that would make people think like no you don't want to get people to do anything that's the Techno solutionist's mindset right that's the problem I've always had with the kind of Humane technology right let's make how can we do all these nasty things to people more humanely right Humane technology it sounds like cage-free chickens or something right we're still eating their eggs right or the chickens themselves it's like no no it's not about how do we make technology treat humans more humanely it's about reversing the polarity altogether right it's not about doing things to humans it's about creating the conditions under which humans can begin to do the things they really want to do which is a very different understanding of it and it's hard it's it's a hard switch so I've been looking at and I came up with kind of four uh interventions let's call them for changing the register and I'll try them out here I haven't really spoken about them before and I realize as I was as I was developing these that they kind of come from the history of the last 30 40 years or whatever I've been writing so the first thing that I do in my work and that I'm imploring we start doing is denaturalize power right and what does that mean it was really what I was trying to do in the book life Inc that I wrote when I was like look at this stuff we call money this is not money right this is a kind of money that was invented by particular people at a particular moment in history who have long since left the building right that's denaturalizing I remember the first experience I had it was um of of denaturalizing power was when I was um first time I really used a real computer at College in the computer lab and the graduate student when I was done with my session she asked me how do you want to save your file as a read-only file or a read write file like what do you mean she said well a read-only file is one that will be saved and someone else can look at it a read write file is you save it but someone else can change it I was like oh all right I'm going read write you know and I left that room thinking wait a minute I've been raised in a world with read-only media television has been read only money is redone why is money read only right they made a law for money if there's a law that it's read only that's how you know it really shouldn't be read only right it's because the only way they can prevent us from turning it into a read write medium is with a regulation and I started walking around thinking my God all this stuff could be read write I'm living in a read write universe that has been arbitrarily limited to a read-only a read-only world I can we can make our own TV we were just getting VHS recorders around then too we can make everything we can DIY we can we can participate in that so the first thing was that was how do you denaturalize power so that people stop accepting social constructions as conditions of nature they're not they're not they're social constructions they're laws made by people at particular moments in history to promote certain agendas and certain power relationships and once you do that once you see the world like that then the next step is to trigger agency right and that was what I was trying to do in the book programmer be programmed even just with the title people don't read books but they read titles and that's enough if you can really Nest it in there right if you're not doing the programming then you are chances are you are being programmed right so how do you trigger people's agency to actually do the thing to actually realize that we are in charge that we can program reality to our own specifications the third thing and this was really my book team human was I realized in order for people to actually act with agency we have to re-socialize people right you can't do this alone right no matter what the Tech Pro says you can't do it alone it doesn't work once you get to the Ginny number of one everybody else is dead right you don't want all the toys if you have all the toys then why are you going to go to someone else's house right there's no toys there to see you don't want all the toys right so re-socializing people and this means going against I know the whole religion of Silicon Valley and their whole bastardization of of Darwin and and and and and Adam Smith and everybody right the the libertarian bastardization of God bless Libertarians you're all good it's all fine but your understanding of Darwin is wrong Darwin did not say we're in a battle for survival of the fittest individual there's like one paragraph about that read the Origin of Species page after page this dude is marveling at the way species collaborate and cooperate in order to ensure Mutual survival that's the dance of nature how did that work and as now we know thanks to our our mushroom users the trees are communicating under the ground through a network of Mycelia right we were all taught in Middle School remember the big tree crowds at the little tree for light and then it gets all the light the little tree dies it's not what's happening big trees getting light and sharing it through a network of Mycelia to sharing its nutrients with the little tree the whole time then when the big tree loses its leaves in this in the winter the little Evergreen then shares stuff back with the big tree they're talking communicating trading and the Miceli are getting a they're actually financializing they're getting uh uh some profit they're they're little toll goes back and forth between them right but we are like trees we can be part of that thing right when when you experience yourself in connection and collaboration with other people it's all happy it's all good don't be afraid Don't Be Afraid Francis Bacon was wrong people are nice dirt is nice worms are nice berries are nice the Moon is nice darkness is cool I mean why is Darkness scary because the boundaries go away right how do I be one better than them if I don't know where they are right which is why finally the the fourth thing that I want to do and this is the one that sounds the most new agey and I don't mean it like that although if you're new AG sure I take it as a as a prop um cultivate awe awe cultivate awe you know this is what I really was writing the book present shock about that present shock that was about the assault of all of our uh uh uh Communications Technologies you know making us uh basically interrupting the present right you can't be where you are now because oh there's an alert oh there's an alert oh there's an alert and we think that we're catching up with our alerts but the alerts have already happened you are in the now the alerts are in the past they don't know what I mean they're they're keeping you from being now present but ah really what we're talking about is moving from the dopamine Rush of the instant technological hit to the oxytocin Rush of connecting with everybody else of actually having that social experience and we know that medically I mean physiologically after an experience of awe people's cytokine response it it affects your cytokine it basically it helps regulate your immune response your immune system gets stronger when you've had an experience of ah you're more generous if you've had an experience of awe you're more generous for like 72 hours after that experience of awe why because an experience of all means experiencing yourself like you know like Buddha orders his hot dog as one with everything right you have that moment of I'm one and then of course you're going to be generous because I am you and you are me and we are me and you know once everything's together you're connected to everything all at once right now so those are the four denaturalize power trigger agency re-socialize people and cultivate awe those are the ways in which I would want to celebrate the end of the billionaire mindset because in reality you know economics and I studied economics in theory that's like my PhD is in digital economics I mean I kind of made it up but still um it counts in the in the world of these things um economics is the last resort economics is what you do if the social fabric didn't work out then you got to go back to the ledger to the tally and say oh and mathematically what happened who owes what to whom someone's mad someone's upset oh look this kid is crying so let's do some economics now but the social fabric should be doing that right as my as my my good friend Corey doctorow brings up you know when when you gonna drill a hole in the wall in your house and you don't have a drill what do you do you go to the Home Depot get a minimum viable product drill right use it once if it works to drill the hole in the wall then stick it in the garage and by the time you try to use it again it won't recharge above and you throw it out so right so you send some kids into the mines to get the Cobalt and the rare earth metals to make this damn rechargeable piece of crap you use it once and then you throw it out and some other kids in Brazil are going to have to pick over the the waste Heap where we send the stuff down to find the renewable part where what you could have done was knock on Bob's door Bob's always making stuff you're not gonna hey Bob can I borrow your drill and Bob's got a big metal [ __ ] Kick-Ass drill and you're like reaching right he's right and Bob's you know I'm gonna come over and drill your hole for you you come over and you'll see where you made the X and you go you don't put the hole there there's no beam back there I got a stud finder here he's gonna find it and he's gonna drill you a great hole in that wall and put up the picture of course the problem is now what do you owe Bob oh [ __ ] we're gonna have to invite Bob over for our New Year's party now yes you are but that's not a bad thing it's a good thing because Bobby can walk over he doesn't even depart it's not going to take any space away from the people who are coming from it's Bob and Bob turns out he's nice and he's got a good baritone when you're singing the carols it's all good right but we experienced that as bad we forgot I mean when someone comes to your neighborhood when they move in the neighborhood what do we do or we used to do anyway you go over with a plate of brownies right when they arrive why do you do that because you're thinking oh man these people aren't going to have enough brownies when they get they need brown they really want their kids climbing the walls you know their first night in the new house when they can't sleep let's give them some sugar no what you're doing is you are uh inviting them into social obligation you give them this so they owe you something and that is a gift in a community to owe something to the other now they have an excuse to come to you and say oh you know we notice your your sprinklers a little off you know my my son knows how to fix those you know you have a reason they have a reason just to bring the [ __ ] plate back and have another conversation you're trying to you're trying to enmesh them in the mutuality of social obligations right the economics is for when those social obligations don't function for whatever reason and even you know economic even technology should be understood as something of a last resort when you really just can't do it with your hands right because if you rely totally on the technology you become enslaved to the tech I mean we've all experienced it right I'm a slave to my to my uh my mouse and keyboard I mean my body has changed right because I'm it's like think about Technologies as as you should be able to let them go right and be fully human any any technology yes it expands you in a certain way but it amputates you in another it's a great thing to use when you want to use it I mean what's the first thing the Israelites did when they got out of Egypt and they're in the desert when they just escaped from from whatever their their their their uh at least mythical and slavery it's the first thing they did they gave themselves the Sabbath right they gave themselves the Sabbath not just as a worker thing which is nice a worker thing they gave them the Sabbath because what they were communicating was like Mr Rogers you know you are okay just the way you are you don't need to work you don't need to produce in order to Justify Your Existence but human beings are more than our utility value we have intrinsic value and that's still so hard for people to get without getting all religious and crazy and God forbid spiritual about things right but we each have intrinsic value we come in you you deserve your place just for the price of admission you made it here is the celebration right but the biases of the digital media environment are telling us that we are our utility value and that's why we are so busy using technology on ourselves to auto-tune ourselves even the way we talk about taking friggin micro dose mushrooms is to tune yourself to this Society now take a fistful God damn don't meet it out here's another right take it as long as you don't get high it's all good but we're Auto tuning ourselves and think about that I mean I understand why they auto-tune Ariana Grande say right little Ariana if she hits her note right right so you can order tunes and it's perfect right the perfect commercial product like I see it's right there right and the technologist would say anything off that note that's the noise right the note is the signal and her what is the noise all right what about James Brown when James Brown is reaching up for that note I got you Doug I'm dancing right now we're going to know we're gonna audit duck I got you done what have we done we've auto-tuned him right but we've eliminated literally we've eliminated the soul from the music the soul is his reaching up the soul is his coming down in over the note the noise if anything is the note itself that every player piano and digital midi blah blah can play the signal is his way he reaches up to the note that's the human being but that's the human when you read James Joyce late at night and you have that I mean or whoever you read but think about if you've ever read James Joy it's not Finnegan's wake too hard but Ulysses say you read that or if you don't want to read Beckett read Malloy or Murphy there's good for me those are the ones that did it you read Ulysses late at night and there's a moment when you're reading it when you go James Joyce is speaking to me right now do you know that moment when the litter I'm the one that he wrote that for that is I prom that is James Joyce's Soul touching your soul that is real right and the extent to which we can accept that that is real gives us the fortitude the ammunition the courage and the heart to fight back against a billionaire mindset that sees us as product to be consumed not as human beings to celebrate okay thank you let's uh Let's Talk Amongst ourselves yeah thanks all right let me let me tell you this I'm going to sign I'm supposed to be pitching my book I got a book survival of the richest Escape fantasies of the tech billionaires I'm gonna sign them right after this is over in the convention center you should know where that is by now the convention center on the third floor 10c if you don't remember that just ask people 10c third floor Convention Center I'll be signing books and talking to anybody who wants to talk or play or take pictures or play games but um let me I'm going to use this thing thank oh see they're seamless seamless that was human beings that did that I want to acknowledge thank you um how do you see AI for the future of humanity I would like to see AI for the future of humanity um I don't I don't currently see it as for the future of humanity I see it I see it as as you know I mean at this point I see it kind of as the Conquistadors I'm not afraid of the AI itself I'm afraid of what people want to do with the AI you know that that New York Times article that came out the guy kind of uh entrapped the Bing AI into acting like a sociopathic jealous person told it to told him to leave his wife that his wife doesn't love him and all that that scared me not because I thought AIS are going to try to do that to us but because I realize AI is no already know more about us than our therapists right ai's already know more about manipulating human behavior than the best behavioral Finance Guru so if they are told by companies to get what you can from this person by any means necessary they're going to figure it out right and they're not going to do it by making us happy right they're going to do it by it by something else so um I'm I'm concerned with how how we program them and again I'm thinking that the only real um in a world where regulation doesn't actually exist the only way that we can uh and I wouldn't even say fight back but um uh maintain ourselves and maintain our humanity is going the more homeopathic naturopathic route right so rather than attacking the sort of the allopathic model would be let's attack the AI what we have to do is increase our cultural immune response right our our and that's through the things I was talking about through re-socializing and having experiences of all the more you're having this social oxytocin all-like experiences the less you're going to Crave the addiction of dopamine and the more you're going to want to melt into the the the you know the joy of Being Human with other ones so there are real our real defense against it is going to be uh raise the level of our of our human connection do you think if there were more female billionaires the mind oh it's gone oh there it is would be different is it all related mostly to patriarchal society well yes didn't know I mean I kind of trace it back to the Aristotelian narrative Arc you know which is kind of the male orgasm curve of of History right crisis climax sleep right the character does a lot of decisions makes them get to say uh um and over and that that um that shape is you know quasi male um but you know and then I look back I read Rianne Eisler on this stuff and she chases it back to metallurgy you know when we once we had metal tools and we get the sword which is cutting and breaking and and destroying it was a uh basically we got storage and chains out of Metallurgy and we got Dominator societies and that's when we moved from uh partnership models to male Dominator models no but but for sake of argument the female the few female billionaire Tech Bros I have met are just as billionaire Tech bro as the male ones you know they may lean in while they do it but it's the same [ __ ] um what would second generation social media platforms look like all of them are second generation social media because real world is the original social media platform right with this we have the best one right and in this social media platform sorry if there's kids here we can actually [ __ ] in this one do you know what I mean it's like this one is so good and look how fast I mean turn your head really fast look how fast it renders I mean it's like [ __ ] this is good right so they're all sick they're all Second Generation and so far I think they all kind of suck um I don't think they're good at socializing I don't really the only things I'm finding successfully socializing in digital spaces is bringing people from far apart with a common interest together but they're small you know and I know I'm not saying that the app is great but like I'm finding deeper conversations on Discord or on my on the Mastodon instance that I'm on it's like I I feel like socialization is enhanced by boundary and I don't mean necessarily racial boundary or belief boundary whatever but um you think like a Dyson vacuum cleaner you know when you get the shh happens because they bound it in those little Cyclone things it's the same with money right if you want to see the circulation of money really go up you do local spending so you see the multiplier effect because it's not sucked out into something else you create an artificial boundary so that things circulate so I would think the generation of social media platforms that I would like to see I think they would work by being contained by not having the aspiration for scaling right scale is the enemy here right human beings don't live at scale we live in this little thing it's like fine I don't I'm not going to get all Dunbar religion on you here but but we do function it's like you don't have to be everything to everyone you really don't that's industrialization and when we try to do that to yourself brand yourself so that you can scale to the thing it's just not happy you know there's a few that Taylor Swift live at scale God bless if she can do it it right but um boy you can live locally you know my greatest theater experience was in a class in college it wasn't even a whole weekend play it was this one friggin moment and that's enough the 12 people were there it was witnessed it was great I mean it's really it's that um do I think the really rich guys will invite me back um sometimes they they have um but no I actually when the book came out when it was actually published I lost two talks right away two Real Money Talks um the mistake was I mean they were into the whole team human thing because team human they like because it sort of sounds like you know HR right how to manage your team you know and then the mistake was my speaking agent emailed them and said instead of buying copies of Team human why don't you buy Doug's new book survival of the richest they're like What's that and they're good um what's the cancellation fee on this right so I lost a couple but I've made a few too and in terms of the the dominatrix stuff is going better than ever right because I've sort of outed myself as as The Punisher um how do I think Marshall mcluhan do you see those oh I only see them um what do you think Marshall mcluhan would say about tech and AI right now um honestly he'd say we went we took a wrong turn at the printing press you know he was a medievalist what he would say though and did say is that digital the digital media environment would at its best retrieve the medieval right I still see digital not as a revolution but as a Renaissance a Renaissance means the rebirth of old ideas in a new context the last Renaissance what did we get we got centralization we got Central currency we got the nation-state replaced the city-state we got the subjugation of women we got uh monarchs we got colonialization I mean they pitched it as something happier but that's we got perspective right but we repressed a whole bunch of stuff so now if we have a Renaissance we get to retrieve all the stuff that was repressed in the last Renaissance right women paganism nature mushrooms uh nature cyclical understandings of things the indigenous people that were repressed during the Renaissance all that stuff comes back so what mcluhan would say is we I mean he was a church man so he would say we'll get the commons right which we hopefully will right the commons which was a church thing and we'll get um manuscripts we'll get uh uh writing and we're kind of I think we're kind of seeing that I would say the wickification of the net which is still happening in a lot of ways is is that so yeah I think I think that's what he would say um what boundaries should be removed in the tech startups world to improve the ecosystem the tech startup world is not an ecosystem sorry um what boundary could be removed to make the tech startup World an ecosystem um it's the whole the tech startup world is just wrong right the whole way the whole way it is the tech startup world is based on the premise of an exit how do we exit and it just doesn't work the the boundary that should be removed would be let's say uh we reverse the tax code so that capital gains are taxed high and dividends and income are taxed low how would that change the startup ecosystem all of a sudden you'll have investors who are like no no don't exit I don't want a taxable event I'm cool with Revenue so why don't we think about a way to make this company actually work for a long time and help people and yeah so that one that would be a good one um all right we got three minutes so I wanna uh I'll just let's do four questions at once you comment on Souls what do what do we do when the billionaire mindset contributes to the death of the flesh Soul two what are the risk red flags of Education designed by billionaires there are lots of certificates coming from Big texts and being more valued than ba degrees what is the examples of business to get human to be more humane what do you think about web 3 purpose to bring sovereignty to people there are good projects all right the way I would bring this that together the billionaire understanding of the realized soul is the self-sovereign individual self sovereignty is an oxymoron you can't beat king and subject you can't be king of yourself right that's the way basically that's the freelance life right where you I mean if you remember if you're a freelancer you know what I mean right you're Your Own Boss and I'm such a bad boss to me I'm killing myself here right but the self-sovereign individual is like this weird uh uh you know snake eating its tail sort of so I'm so self-sufficient I am King and subject of my own nation of me right in that Mobius strip construction is the death of the flesh soul right that is the negation of the Carnet being right all I am is the rule set the program and the Machine right so to the education model what we have to do I think the easiest way to break that is to change the purpose of school right now you talk to school principals talk to the Presidents of universities and you know who they're meeting with to find out how to change their curriculum they're meeting with Czech bro billionaire CEOs what skills do you want our students to have what skills do you want our students to have I'm going to pay 80 000 a year to train myself for this freaking Corporation or my public school since when is the purpose of public school to be to absorb the externalized cost of worker training for corporations school was the opposite school was invented for the opposite reason it was to give the co-worker a bit of dignity so after they got out of the coal and went home at night they can open a novel and read it and understand what it said so they could read the newspaper and be informed about the issues and vote effectively it was compensation for a a life of work not the path to a life of work so if we flip education on its head and say this is not about increasingly utility value of these students but increasing the awareness of the intrinsic human value of these people we flip the whole script just like that right they are no longer in the machine metaphor or the digital metaphor for Learning and experience they're in a room with a teacher they're doing want to give some feel some props you know they're doing Nemesis okay they're looking at a human being up there learning exploring understanding and their bodies are mirroring what that is in real time in real space right and that you know that is a a a a reinforcement or acknowledgment of the the basic human dignity that everybody has and that's you know what we all need to learn to be students of okay thanks a lot [Applause] [Music]
