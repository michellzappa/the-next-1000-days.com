THIS MORNING I AM LIVE IN PARIS TECH CEOs DESCENDING HERE IN PARIS. I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN FOR A HALF-HOUR INTERVIEW WITH THE FRENCH PRESIDENT EMMANUEL  MACRON AND EXCLUSIVE CONVERSATION OVER TECHNOLOGY WHICH HAS BEEN FOCUS FOR THIS  PRESIDENT SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE SEVEN YEARS AGO. WE SPOKE ABOUT THAT AND WHAT HE  THINKS IS DRIVING THE INNOVATION FOR ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE ROLE OF FRANCE AND HOW TO  BALANCE THE ISSUES OF A.I. WITH  JOBS AND THE WORK FORCE AND  INEQUALITY TAKE A LOOK. >> IT IS TRUE THAT A FEW DAYS  AGO WE HOSTED THE FIRST FORUM TO ATTRACT BUSINESSES AND INVESTMENT IN TECH AND OTHER SECTORS AS WELL WITH $50 BILLION FOR THIS SESSION WE HAVE VIVA TECH WHICH WAS  CREATED A FEW YEARS AGO AND NOW  A HUGE SUCCESS WE HAVE ALL OF THE A.I. PLAYERS  COMING FROM ALL OF THE WORLD I DO BELIEVE THAT THE TECH INDUSTRY IS ONE OF THE KEY FACTORS OF TRANSFORMATION. INNOVATION AND GROWTH CREATES A  LOT OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR QUALIFIED AND QUALIFIED PEOPLE THIS IS A BIG SOURCE OF MOBILITY IN OUR SOCIETY.  >> UNQUALIFIED PEOPLE, TOO >> YES, BOTH I SPOKE ABOUT THIS ON THIS STAGE, BUT IT PROVIDES A LOT FOR EXISTING BUSINESSES AND PROVIDES QUALIFIED AND UNQUALIFIED JOBS BY TRANSFORMING EXISTING BUSINESS AND LARGE CAPS. THIS IS WHY I BELIEVE IN THE SECTOR AND I CLEARLY BELIEVE THAT FRANCE SHOULD BE ONE OF THE LEADERS IN THIS FIELD. WE MULTIPLY TEN IN TEN YEARS FOR TECH WHEN YOU TAKE THE DIFFERENCE WITH THE U.S. AND EUROPE, WE ARE LAGGING BEHIND THE GROWTH PER KCAPITA IS HALF I EUROPE AS IN THE U.S. AS THE PATH INDICATES THE MAIN DRIVER IS PRECISELY THE LACK OF INNOVATION WE HAVE TO DO MUCH BETTER. THIS IS THE CASE FRANCE IS LEADING THE TECH INDUSTRY IN EUROPE WE WANT TO MULTIPLY PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER PLACES IN THE WORLD A.I. IS NOT JUST A SECTOR. IT IS A HUGE REVOLUTION. IT WILL COMPLETELY TRANSFORM EDUCATION, DEMOCRACY, WORK, A  LOT OF THINGS. I THINK OUR CHALLENGE FOR A.I. ACCELERATES AND INNOVATES. >> THE CEO AS YOU CALLED HIM THE FRENCH GENIUS SAYS THE BIGGEST RISK OF A.I. IS THE WORKPLACE  REVOLUTION >> I THINK THIS IS NOT JUST A  RISK A.I. WILL BE A REVOLUTION FOR  WORK FOR GOOD AND BAD. GOOD, IT IS QUITE SURE IT WILL INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY. YOU KNOW, IT WAS ONE OF THE BIG  MYSTERIES OF OUR ECONOMIC LIVES  THAT SOCIAL NETWORKS AND THE SOCIAL ECONOMY WAS NOT POSSIBLE  AS AN INCREASE OF PRODUCTIVITY CLEARLY, IT WILL BE THE CASE WITH A.I IT WILL COMPLETELY TRANSFORM --  >> THAT MAY MEAN A LOT OF JOBS >> I AGREE WITH YOU. IT WILL PUSH US TO SHIFT A LOT OF CALQUALIFICATIONS THIS IS WHY WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND AND PROGRESSIVELY BE  AWARE OF THAT AND EDUCATE OUR  PEOPLE AND WE HAVE TO WORK VERY  HARD ON THE QUALIFICATIONS OF A  LOT OF PEOPLE. WE HAVE TO TRAIN AND QUALIFY A LOT OF PEOPLE. THE BIG QUESTION AND YOU KNOW I  SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE WHERE IT IS LESS USED IN THE 1990s, TECH REVOLUTION  WAS THE BIG DEBATE WESTERN ECONOMIES OR ECONOMIES WITH A CERTAIN LEVEL OF WAGES  WITH THE HIGH COST OF LABOR WHEN THEY ADOPT, THEY PRESERVED THE FOOTPRINT. WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE ROBOTS IN  FRANCE WE FOCUS ON CAPACITY THE QUESTION IS HOW A.I. WILL BE AT THE SERVICE OF HUMANITY AND NOT JUST SEEN AS A SUBSTITUTE OF HUM HUMANITY WE HAVE RISKS. WE HAVE TO ASSESS THEM WE HAVE TO LEAD INNOVATION TO BE IN A SITUATION TO REGULATE IN APPROPRIATE TERMS AND SAY I WANT A.I. AT THE SERVICE OF  HUMANITY AND INCREASE  PRODUCTIVITY AND IN A  SUBSTITUTE I HAVE TO MAXIMIZE THE NUMBER OF GOOD JOBS IN MY ECONOMY. >> LET'S ASK THIS. THIS IS A PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION OF ATTRACTING START-UPS TO FRANCE I THINK YOU WANT TO FOSTER ENTRE ENTRE ENTREPRENEURSHIP HERE IN FRANCE. WHEN YOU THINK OF THE FOLKS WHO  STARTED GOOGLE OR META, THEY WENT ON TO BECOME BILLIONAIRES I WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE PARADOX OF HOW YOU UNDERSTAND HOW YOU  CREATE THE PEOPLE WHO MAY BECOME PEOPLE OF GREAT WEALTH IN A  COUNTRY WHICH HAS A COMPLICATED  VIEW OF WEALTH >> I THINK WEALTH IS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT STORY EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD. IT IS TRUE THAT FRANCE IS  FOCUSED ON EQUALITY MUCH MORE  THAN OTHERS. WE HAVE AN INTERESTING TAXATION. I GOT RID OF THE TAX WHEN I WAS  ELECTED PRESIDENT. I PUT IN PLACE A FLAT TAX. THAT IS HOW WE ATTRACTED A LOT OF VARIABLES WE HAVE TO PROMOTE SUCCESS THROUGH INNOVATION I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT IN  OUR SOCIETY TO MAKE A CLEAR  DISTINCTION. YOU CAN HAVE SUCCESSFUL PEOPLE WHEN THEY PERFORM AS ARTISTS OR  IN SPORT, BUT AS IN BUSINESS AS  INNOVATION IS GOOD FOR EVERYBODY BECAUSE THEY CREATE VALUE FOR  THE WHOLE PEOPLE YOU HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT AS A WISE ECONOMY OF TENANTS. YOU KILL YOUR OWN CAPACITIES IF  YOU REJECT THIS MODEL. ON THE OTHER SIDE, THE QUESTION  IS HOW TO RESIST THAT POINT IN TIME AND AVOID THAT IN 10 OR 20  OR 30 YEARS WHERE IT WILL BE THE CHILDREN OF THOSE WHO HAVE THE TALENTS WILL GET BENEFITS OF THE ECONOMY. IT IS TRUE IN OUR SOCIETY THE  LEVEL OF WEALTH IS MORE AND MORE IN QUESTION. IT IS A TRADITION IN FRANCE THAT CHANGES THAT I WANTED TO TRANSFORM THIS APPROACH THIS IS A GOOD GLOBAL DEBATE I THINK HAVING THE WEALTH TAX IS A GLOBAL DEBATE. I PUSH WITH THE U.S. AND WITH  BRAZIL AND OTHERS A GLOBAL TAX WHICH IS MORE RELEVANT THAN A  FRENCH OR EUROPEAN ONE OTHERWISE, THE TENANTS --  >> I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SAW THIS. JANET YELLEN IS AGAINST A WEALTH TAX. THE TREASURY SECRETARY OF THE  UNITED STATES. DID YOU SEE THAT >> THIS IS A PITY. THE G20 DISCUSSION THIS IS A GOOD GLOBAL TAX AS A MINIMUM TAX WE PUSH IN THE AGENDA AS A DIGITAL TAX. YOU HAVE TO AVOID BIG  DISCREPANCIES. I THINK EVEN IN THE U.S. SOCIETY, MORE AND MORE PEOPLE  NOW ARE A LITTLEIT SHOCKED OR  UPSET BY THE LEVEL OF WEALTH IT'S FURTHER WHEN YOU ARE  INNOVATIVE AND SUCCESSFUL, YOU GET MONEY. WHEN YOU CREATE BIG INNOVATION,  EVEN MORE. I THINK THIS IS THE RIGHT  QUESTION WITH THE SCALE OF THE PLANET TO SAY WE NEED MORE FIRMNESS I THINK IT IS AN ISSUE TO DO FOR PEOPLE ON THE NATIONAL SCALE >> YOU MENTIONED ARTISTS BEFORE  AND CREATIVITY THE CANNES FILM FESTIVAL IS  HAPPENING NOW. I WANTED TO ASK YOU. OPENAI SAID IT WOULD NO LONGER USE A VOICE A SOUNDED LIKE SCARLETT JOHANSSON, THE MOVIE  STAR, BECAUSE THE VOICE WAS TOO  CLOSE TO HER VOICE SHE WAS UPSET ABOUT THAT EVEN THOUGH IT WAS DONE BY ANOTHER ACTRESS. I'M CURIOUS GIVEN YOUR THOUGHTS  ABOUT CREATIVITY AND WHETHER YOU THINK A.I. SHOULD BE ABLE AND  THIS IS AN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ISSUE AND COPYRIGHT ISSUE SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE A VOICE THAT  SOUNDS LIKE SOMEBODY ELSE'S  VOICE. SOMEBODY MAY DO THIS TO YOU ONE  DAY. >> I'M ASKING THE iPHONE TO  TRANSLATE SPEECHES IN DIFFERENT  LANGUAGES. THIS IS THE ISSUE WE MAKE WITH THE COMPANY YOU MENTIONED AT ARGUE. I THINK THE BIG QUESTIONS WE HAVE ON THE TABLE AND IT WOULD BE THE QUESTION WE WOULD ASK DURING THE A.I. ACTION SUMMIT WE HAVE IN PERSON IN FEBRUARY OF  2025 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES IS ONE OF THEM. I BELIEVE WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR ARTISTS AND OUR WRITERS AND ALL  OF THE DIFFERENT ARTISTS FROM  ANY THREAT AND WE HAVE TO  PROTECT THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY A.I. SHOULD NOT BE SEEN AS A THREAT IF WE CREATE THE PROPER REGULATION I DO BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO DO  THAT SOON. A GLOBAL REGULATION. THIS IS WHY IN THIS CONVERSATION THAT WE NEED THE U.S. AND CHINA  AND THE BIG ECONOMIES AND  INNOVATORS OF THE PLANET TO  PRECISELY PROTECT THIS A.I >> LET'S ASK ABOUT THE BIG TECH  AND REGULATION THE COMPANY HERE IN FRANCE HAS A PARTNERSHIP WITH MICROSOFT A NUMBER OF THE BIG A.I. COMPANIES ARE PARTNERING WITH  BIG TECH ALL OVER AGAIN. IF MICROSOFT CALLED UP YOU AND SAID WE WANT TO BUY YOU, ARE THEY SUCH A NATIONAL CHAMPION  AND SAY I CAN'T DO IT? WHAT DO YOU THINK OF BIG TECH  GETTING BIGGER >> I DON'T THINK IT IS GOOD  NEWS I PREFER THEM TO BE INDEPENDENT  AND GROW ON THEIR OWN BECAUSE I  THINK M&A IS PART OF THE BUSINESS LIFE FOR SURE WHAT WE LOOK WITH A LOT OF BIG TECH AND GIANTS DURING THE PAST  FEW YEARS IS THEY HAD CONTRARY INNOVATION M&A MANY PROPOSALS JUST TO DIGEST  MORE INNOVATION AND TO BE SURE THEY TAKE THE INNOVATION, BUT  MAKE SURE OTHER GUYS DON'T GO  FURTHER TO JEOPARDIZE THEM I THINK IT IS GOOD FOR THE U.S.  ECOSYSTEM TO HAVE A VIVID AND  VIBRANT AND AMBITIOUS EUS ECOSYM WE NEED MUCH MORE EUROPEAN BIG PLAYERS. I THINK A LOT OF INVESTMENT AND  THEY LOOK TO DECIDE HERE THE MO
