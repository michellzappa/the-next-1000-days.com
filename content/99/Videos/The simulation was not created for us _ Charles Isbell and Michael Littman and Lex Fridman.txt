you mentioned the matrix do you think we're living in a simulation it does feel like a thought game more than a real scientific question well i'll tell you why like i think it's an interesting thought experiment to see what you think from a computer science perspective it's a good experiment of how difficult would it be to create a sufficiently realistic world that us humans would enjoy being in it that that's almost like if we're living in a simulation then i don't believe that we were put in the simulation i believe that it's just physics playing out and we came out of that like i don't i don't i don't think so you think you have to build the universe yeah i think the universe itself we can think of that as a simulation and in fact what i try sometimes i try to think about to understand what it's like for a computer to start to think about the world i try to think about the world um things like quantum mechanics where it doesn't feel very natural to me at all and it really strikes me as i don't understand this thing that we're living in it has there's weird things happening in it that don't feel natural to me at all now if you want to call that as the result of a simulator okay i'm fine with that but like i don't know the bugs in the simulation there's the bugs i mean the interesting thing about the simulation is that it might have bugs i mean that that's the thing that i the but there wouldn't be bugs for the people in this simulation they're just that's just reality unless you were fair enough to know that there was a bug but i i think back to the matrix yeah the way you put this i don't think that we live in a simulation created for us okay i would say that i think that's interesting i've actually never thought about it that way i mean you the way you asked the question though is could you create a world that is enough for us humans it's an interestingly sort of self-referential question because the beings that created the simulation probably have not created a simulation that's realistic for them but we're in the simulation and so it's realistic for us so we could create a simulation that is fine for the people in the simulation as it were that would not necessarily be fine for us as the creators of the simulation but well you can you can forget i mean when you go into the if you play video games in virtual reality you can if with some suspension of disbelief or whatever uh it becomes a world it becomes the world even like in brief moments you forget that another world exists i mean that's what like good stories do they pull you in and the question is is it possible to pull you know our brains are limited is it possible to pull the brain in to where we actually stay in that world longer and longer and longer and longer and like not only that but we don't want to leave and so especially this is the key thing about the developing brain is if we journey into that world early on in life often how would you even know yeah yeah so i i but like from a video game design perspective from a west world perspective it's i think i think it's an important thing for even uh computer scientists to think about because it's clear that video games are getting much better and virtual reality although it's been ups and downs just like artificial intelligence it feels like virtual reality will be here in a very impressive form if we were to fast forward 100 years into the future in a way that might change society fundamentally like if i were to i'm very limited in predicting the future as all of us are but if i were to try to predict like in which way i'd be surprised to see the world 100 years from now it'd be that or impressed it'd be that we're all no longer living in this physical world that we're all living in a virtual world you really need to be calculating god by sawyer it's a he'll read it in a night it's a very easy read but it's uh assuming you're that kind of reader but it's a it's a good story and it's kind of about this but not in a way that it appears and i uh really enjoyed the thought experiment um i think it's pretty sure it's robert sawyer but anyway he's he's apparently canadian's top science fiction writer which is why this story mostly takes place in toronto uh but it's a it's a very good uh it's a very good sort of story that sort of imagines this very different kind of simulation hypothesis sort of thing from say um the egg for example you know you know i'm talking about the short story um by the guy who did the martian who wrote the martian you know matt damon no the book so we had this whole discussion that michael doesn't uh doesn't partake in this exercise of reading he doesn't seem to like it which seems very strange to me concerning how much he has to read i read all the time i used to read 10 books every week when i was a when i was in sixth grade or whatever i was a lot of science fiction a lot of it a lot of history but i i love to read but anyway you should recalculating god i think you'll you'll it's very easy read like i said i think you'll enjoy sort of the ideas that it presents yeah i think the the thought experiment is quite interesting um one thing i've noticed about people growing up now i mean we talked about social media but video games is a much bigger bigger and bigger and bigger part of their lives and then and the video games have become much more realistic i think it's possible that the three of us are not uh maybe the two of you are not familiar exactly with the numbers we're talking about here the number of people it's bigger than movies right it's it's it's huge i used to do a lot of the narrative computational narrative stuff i understand that economists can actually see the impact of video games on the labor market that there are there there's fewer young men of a certain age participating in like paying jobs than you'd expect and and that they trace it back to video games i mean the problem with star trek was not warp drive or teleportation it was the holodeck like if you have the holodeck that's it that's it you go in the holodeck you never come out i mean it just never made once i saw that i thought okay well so this is the end of humanity as we know it right they've invented the holiday because that feels like the singularity not some agi or whatever it's some possibility to go into another world that can be artificially made better than this one and slowing it down so you live forever or speeding it up so you appear to live forever or making the decision of when to die and then most of us will just be old people on the porch yelling at the kids these days in their virtual reality [Music] but they won't hear us because they've got headphones on you
