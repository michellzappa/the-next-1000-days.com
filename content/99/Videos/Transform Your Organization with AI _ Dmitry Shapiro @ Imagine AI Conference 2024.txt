I'm the CEO of Mind Studio prior to that I spent four years at Google uh running product on three machine learning teams prior to that I was the chief technology officer of Myspace music for any of those that remember Myspace and prior to that I built two other Venture back companies one was a major competitor to YouTube called vetworks raised $70 million there um prior to that I built a cyber security company called aconic systems raised $34 million there and then in the mid90s '95 to 99 I built the web team at this big Japanese company called Fujitsu so these days I describe myself as an old nerd and so uh super excited to chat with you um so M Studio came out of alpha early beta in September and has grown uh quite rapidly uh we now have over 34,00 thousand AIS that have been built and deployed in various types of organizations giant Enterprises government agencies thousands of smbs solopreneurs um using it and 86% of our growth is organic and all of it is self-service so we're an Enterprise company that has zero salespeople uh and people show up you know go to our website watch some YouTube tutorials start building these AIS and figure out how to do them and so I'm going to share with you some of these things that we're learning from this like critical mass of different types of organizations that are already using U mind Studio to do basically digital transformation in their Enterprises and so these are sort of like common patterns that we see of how Enterprises go about uh sort of discovering Ai and then sort of evolving as uh they're doing this and this evolution is happening very rapidly I mean you all came to this conference so you know that uh even if all you're doing is spending all day long like watching The Evolution no one can really keep up with it and in Enterprises there's a tremendous amount of pressure that they're feeling kind of from all sides of you better get AI right and better get it right now otherwise you're dead so it feels like an existential crisis and you get um just sort of tremendous amount of of uh of of exuberance for AI that again that's driving both the evolution of all of these Technologies and a lot of money pouring in and obviously a lot of these Enterprises showing up uh and then on the other side employees inside of Enterprises are all freaking out that AI is going to you know sort of replace them and so you get sort of this like mismatch of incentives the Enterprise wants productivity and and you know to be competitive the employees are freaking out that the Enterprise is going to implement Ai and they're going to be out of a job uh and and so you know as these sort of pressures Mount Enterprises tend to start down the path of figuring out how they're going to leverage AI in the first place they tend to come to as like oh there is this chap GPT thing or any of these other large language models let's just arm all of our employees with chat GPT and look it's amazing you can just type some commands to it and it spits out work check all of a sudden productivity uh and then we got to teach them how to use this and so we can teach them this like concept of prompt engineering right and and so you see Enterprises like holding classes and and you know buying these like long lists of prompts from other providers and sort of copying and pasting these prompts uh in their daily work as these employees sort of struggle to get productivity and of course managers are figuring out we're not really getting sort of this like promise of productivity this like crazy productivity that AI was supposed to do uh and so why uh again once they start sort of observing it they start to realize our employees are still doing work but the work they're doing now is sort of wrangling AI to try to do the work for them and they could have sort of done it themselves but now they're spending their time prompt engineering and doing this and by the way the output seems not to be as good as when the employees were doing the work themselves so so this is a real problem uh and then you know they start blaming the model providers you know we chose the wrong model so maybe we not using open AI let's go and sort of go through a process of figuring out what model to use uh and that's scary and they sort of get stuck in analysis paralysis there uh there are so many models it's constantly changing you know last week open AI was the winner now anthropic is the winner tomorrow somebody else is the winner uh inflection doesn't even exist anymore right looks like Microsoft who pulled all the the people out of that so this is these are all sort of problems of of engaging in this kind of analysis of like what should we standardize uh on uh and then of course everybody's like oh maybe we shouldn't be doing that at all maybe we should just sort of train our own models and then they're like okay what are we supposed to do with that we got to go find data scientists we got to figure out to procure our h100s and like all of this stuff um some Enterprises uh when again they've sort of gone through the Pains of arming their employees with a direct access to models uh often times uh figure out that maybe we should look at sort of these professional organizations that are these like vertical SAS providers that have figured this stuff out and maybe we just sort of give our employees these new tools tools that have been built specifically to sort of abstract the models and and and make them do the things that we want our employees to be able to do better U popular ones of course are things like Jasper copywriter Etc and then it's like what else should we do so these are like for writing what about like for graphics or all of these other things and then they get into this world of oh wow it looks like I've got like I need to choose from a bunch of vendors for sales and a bunch of other vendors for marketing and Ops and then you start to figure out well like how do we train all of our employees to do this like H how do we manage all of these systems like how many of these things do we need and so these again more analysis paralysis um in the Enterprise and then after all of that they tend to discover mind studio and as I mentioned uh over 86% of our growth is organic uh they typically find us because they see somebody talking about us on social media or they stumbled across some YouTuber doing a tutorial about how to use mind Studio to build things and they show up to our website and they start learning and we've got this learn section they they watch some tutorials they look at some examples um and all of the sudden they start to realize that they're now seeing the world in sort of a very different way than they were seeing it you know just moments before where it seemed like all you need to do is give employees access to models or you know sort of figure out how to use these vertical SAS Services now you start to say well the right way perhaps to look at it is like to look at my organization and the way it operates sort of through this new lens and again once you understand how mind Studio Works everything sort of becomes clear and you start to realize that you can build your own custom you know business applications that leverage AI we call them AI powered applications and and you can them yourself extraordinarily rapidly like in 15 minutes to maybe a couple of hours for really really sophisticated business applications that are built to fit your organization like a glove so that's a that's huge uh you also realize that you never needed to choose between anthropic or open AI or any of these things that was a a Fool's errand you should be able to use any or all of these models because again everything is constantly changing and so you need to be Model A notic uh and most AIS that are built with M studio now actually leverage multiple models from multiple vendors for multiple model providers inside of individual AIS so they might start a workflow you can build these like multi-step workflows and collect some information for example from your business users as part of doing this workflow and then you might take that information and merge it with some data you have from the Enterprise and then you might call call one model to take all of this information sort of extract some Salient points and that model uh that you want to call might be optimized for Speed and low cost because it's pretty easy to be able to like analyze a bunch of data now and pull out some salian points you might then bring that back and Route it through more process and and do some more work on it and then call sort of a slower and maybe more expensive model to be able to then take all of that information and do some writing or do some content generation so this is ability to use any AI or many AIS is extremely uh important uh the other thing you realize is that again as you look at at your workflows as you look at your business processes through this new lens you start to realize these things we've been doing manually we can actually just automate them and we don't have to do them manually anymore so this s like the first step typically of this digital transformation uh that we see Enterprises doing once they learn to use mind studio is to say like we can automate this and we can automate that we don't have to worry about that stuff anymore and then uh for the things that you can't automate that you still need people to do again through this new lens you start to realize that we can take these various job functions and and create custom assistance for them so again instead of giving people just access to go talk to chat GPT and it'll help you figure out give them a custombuilt assistant a conversational agent that's built specifically for their job function that's trained on the data that your company has and and on on sort of the sensitivities of the company and sort of all these other things and now employees become more productive because they've got these agents uh these assistants that have been built for them specifically to do their job in this new um workflow that you're designing um the other thing of course that's super important in Enterprises is to be able to take all of these things and integrate them into your existing stack and so that becomes a critical part of all that again you realize that that's actually very straightforward to do and and so you do that uh and then you sort of have the big realization as like oh we don't have to go and sort of retrain all our employees to be prompt Engineers uh as you guys know they never learned Google search operators so it's crazy to believe that we're going to train regular people to be prompt Engineers we should have known that all along um and so he gets her this dumb moment uh and and again we got a lot of uh you know people that reach out to us that sort of Express this like oh once I realized that it was like duh now this totally makes sense to me and I'm not scared of of AI anymore uh so mind studio is a you know horizontal platform that um has sort of a a number of components uh and those two top layers that you see there uh one it sits on top of all of your you know Enterprise data obviously data is very important in really being able to leverage AI to to get work done and so you can connect to any of your data sources and ingest them and and and have them be you know kept fresh and and used as part of the uh of the operations of this new uh AI enabled Enterprise um as I mentioned you can use any model you want out of the box we support open Ai and topic Google meta mistol um you can connect to any open source model uh a lot of Enterprises you know larger ones especially uh have taken open- Source models have fine-tuned them are running you know uh models on premise or in their own private clouds so you can connect to those and you can connect to any um Enterprise application you use you know via apis um and on top of that mind Studio has a really powerful no code Builder uh that anyone can learn to use just again typically by watching uh one or two YouTube tutorials we have an 18-minute tutorial that we'll get you running and you'll feel like oh wow I can build AI applications and then we have a two-hour recorded webinar or you can attend our weekly live webinars and in two hours really really sort of become a master of it and then we also have an 8 Hour uh it's typically held on on Saturdays uh certification course since there's a lot of people now that are getting certified in being um mind Studio AI developers because again there's a lot of need from Enterprises and some of those Enterprises are now showing up and asking us if we can recommend people that can help them get up to speed faster and and and help them do the work so we do that too so lots of Education to be able to do that um and and um you know the snow code Builder basically allows you to create these multi-step workflows you can create one or many uh and the AIS you can create sort of come in two flavors uh one is they have uh you know they're they're meant for humans to drive them so they're just like these web applications that have screens and and you know they in have input and output and they've got forms and so they're meant for employees to use them and interact with them and another flavor are these headless AIS that have no human interfaces they are driven programmatically by other services you know calling them via API a lot of people tend to use things like zapier or make.com to be able to create triggers for various things and then call these custom AIS that they've created with mind Studio to be able uh to do that and again as part of these workflows you can get input output uh you know with users uh or uh apis you can um you know have all kinds of logic you can create menus you can uh as you're building these uh you can sort of give them access to all of this data that your Enterprise has we make it really easy to automatically take that data turn it into Vector embedding store it in a vector database and as part of this uh operation of these AIS you can query these Vector databases to be able to do retrieve log Meed generation and things like that um you can call any thirdparty apis or WR your own custom JavaScript functions that you can write so lots of power uh with no code and then with a little bit of code maybe help from it uh again just regular business users can create really sophisticated applications um and then we provide all of this Enterprise stuff that's required you know user rights management and logging archiving compliance uh coming soon the ability to take all of this uh and sort of run AI business intelligence on top of that and on these um uh uh conversational assistants that I was mentioning this ability to create these custom sort of chat GPT like assistance for each uh job function because all of that is now running through this inter uh Enterprise infrastructure and because you're logging all of that that becomes uh all of these data sources for this business intelligence and you start to realize that your employees even using AI are still doing some things manually and you see the sort of cluster and you say oh we can now take this no code Builder and build another one of these automations or a better assistant form so it all continues to uh evolve and again we're seeing a lot of evolution already for people who have like transformed their their their operations with mind Studio but now are sort of now refreshing it again and refreshing it again and doing so it's an ongoing process um we are already seeing with again over 34,000 of these AI applications created um kind of every job function being impacted by this sales often takes the lead obviously because everybody wants more Revenue uh and uh there you're seeing all kinds of sort of approaches to it at every step of the sales process so everything from taking a bunch of sort of leads that are being ingested in some way and then having AI take the first stab at being able to parse those rank them classify them figure out which ones to sort of put in what buckets and what sales people to give them to and and all of that sort of like lead qualification and and cleaning using AI uh then throughout the process you know we all see now all of these you know transcribing agents that are joining all of our video conferences and things like that mostly that stuff goes into some whole dozen provide real value but now it does because you can create AIS that watch all of that and start to uh become a a sort of a a proactive assistant for salespeople in their Communications with um with prospects uh salespeople often get what's known as happy years they're excited to get the sale they think that the prospect is ready to close and the AI might tell them the prospect is nowhere near ready to close they still don't understand this this and this and then by the way sort of on the marketing side dayi can come in and say I'm gonna automatically create custom um collaterals for each Prospect to fill in the gaps of things that they're still not grocking and and now assist that right uh also on marketing you start to see by the way I've always really struggled with this is again I've now built three Venture back companies and all of these companies would go through this like process of figuring out kind of this ideal customer profile or personas and all of these things that marketing teams tend to do um and it's always been clear to me that like these things are caricatures there are no such people as these things that we claim of these like personas uh and of course that's how we build websites for these personas with these solution Pages all of that is about to change radically as content can be generated on the Fly for each person in the sense that's visiting our collaterals our website so this on the-fly generation of custom materials for each individual or Enterprise that you're communicating with um is a is a is a giant unlock uh for that and of course on all of this obviously having the um AI uh you know do things of like analyzing data and that's sort of spit out of all of these marketing and and sales processes and and and sort of AI having the time to pay attention and to sort of read between the lines of what's not being said for example in email conversations that are going back and forth uh the sort of detection of anomalies and deeper insights that humans have no time to do they could have done it but ain't nobody got time for that and so AI uh can can do those things um again on every function I'll stay a little bit more on this like so HR recruiting obviously doing everything from taking all of these resumés that are coming in and and and and uh classifying them and and and sort of figuring out uh sort of ranking them which folks to Bubble up to the top uh two uh we're seeing a lot of this like training where um organizations are creating AI trainers that engage engage with their employees and do sort of ongoing employee assessment and sort of finding strengths and weaknesses of employees and filling in you know the weaknesses and providing custom training materials for employees to do that employee onboarding lots of applications uh in HR and sort of again any of these uh other functions there too um and again all of this is growing uh really rapidly uh and and so we're sort of trying to figure out how not to blow up uh we're actually a small company for being able to do that and so we're desperately you know trying to hire people and document things and scale our training and scale support and all of that and so um I guess the the the big punchline of all of this is like oh if you think about AI uh if we rewind like a year ago a year ago uh you know my social media feeds were blowing up with like you know really smart people that I've known for many years that were making like these bold claims that there was going to be sort of one company left standing and at that time that company was clearly going to be open Ai and they will get to AGI and not only will AGI figure out how AI how open AI is going to make money which is what Sam Alman said is that their business model is we're going to build AGI and AGI is going to figure out the business model right so there was that and then there's like all of this argument because you will get to this AGI it will know much better than any Enterprise could ever know how to run Enterprises and therefore you'll just be able to say to it build me a multi-trillion dollar Enterprise go and it goes and builds this Enterprise for you and raises money and does all that and you know one of my friends whose name I won't mention was a brilliant guy argued that Tesla was going to be disrupted because open AI was going to build cars because why not open AI is going to know better how to build cars than Elon and team do I think we've gone for most people I think we've gotten past this sort of I'll call it craziness of believing this um and and so I guess my advice to all of you from what we're seeing out there is like don't wait don't wait for you know GPT f or whatever else is coming next uh AI has incredible capabilities right now technology we have right now at our disposal can dramatically you know make any Enterprise uh more productive and and so you know I encourage you to do it now and then you get flexibility like my friend Sean here uh with with that okay are there any questions that I can answer I think we still have four minutes yes could you speak up please do you also have tools that allow for reinforce reinforcement learning from the organization itself to be able to improve output of queries against the um Dom we don't in the platform today um so again we're even though um you know the domain is mind studio. and we call ourselves an AI platform uh we don't have a single data scientist on staff we don't build any models we don't train any models we're sort of the substraction layer right we're we're sort of the application layer of AI sort of abstracting all of the innovative in models all of the innovation in sort of the underlying infrastructure and creating a stable base for people to build applications that do that anything that has to do with the intelligence layer itself you know fine tuning reinforcement learning any of that stuff is done outside of our platform yes do this is cool do you have any deployment in highly regulated Industries like banking where data protection is those standards are a lot higher and and how are you what does the security layer look like yeah um so at at this point we actually don't have any certifications which we're working on to clearly going to be needed for a lot of Industries but there are already uh actually surprising to us uh many uh organizations that have compliance and and and and regul uh requirements that're already using mind Studio because sort of the value proposition is is so compelling to them so I think uh for each organization I think they kind of have to make a decision of like uh you know uh are we willing to sort of trust this platform that hasn't sort of yet been audited and and and vetted and have these certifications for doing that from um you know from security standpoint we run in modern cloud and F follow all the best practices for securing model uh modern Cloud um we uh organizations that are very sensitive about using for example uh these large language models um even though I generally think they should be trusted from these large companies but they might not trust them and so they tend to um to run their own inference on their own models and then they connect directly to that so there are ways you can sort of uh overcome sort of the the fear of or or the need for uh compliance uh by sort of choosing the right way to architect your Solutions using mind Studio but we give you the flexibility to do that uh this is a question I get often and I always struggle to answer it because I'm not sure I think depends on how you sort of choose to rank things uh as I showed you uh recently in some of these in that matrix it's already being used for every job function sort of imaginable sales and marketing again just in our experience tend to be early adopters and so we're typically found not by sort of the the it group and sort of top down it's it uh typically comes with that somebody in an Enterprise discovers this starts playing around with it brings it into the Enterprise uh build some capabilities and then other employees see them doing that and they get trained and then later you know it or procurement reaches out to us to do that um and and um yeah but I but I think just depends on what part of the organization you sit in where where you'd find Value it makes a ton of sense uh should I be thinking about this more like a an AI IDE where it's a design studio or is this more like an infrastructure piece like the the new AWS to run my AI apps how do you monetize it yeah it's uh it's both it's an IDE an integrated development environment that allows you to learn to use it and build these things and then it's also the the thing that runs it uh and and so it's both uh we monetize it uh in the following way there's a free tier uh that anyone can start using instantly uh we give you some credit for you know inference and and vectorization and querying uh Vector databases and such and then when you sort of uh uh go beyond a threshold then you have to put on your credit card and we charge you metered you know billing for the resources that you use and there's also a uh a pro tier which is if you have a team and you want to have a collaborative workspace and be able to create AIS and share them and and you know do that uh and get better support and things like that and then coming shortly is an Enterprise tier that gives you more of these sort of capabilities that enterprises need slas and and and compliance and and all of that it's SAS meter SAS build yes yeah that's it's funny that you bring that up earlier this morning I was having a meeting specifically about that uh in fact thank you I meant to mention this uh we now have a lot of I'll call them agencies that are already using mind studio and doing work for Enterprises or reaching out to us and sort of wanting to Now train their agency employees to do this kind of work um and and so yeah that that's coming shortly there's actually a um I guess I'm not going to announce it here yeah but soon we'll be announced a very large company that is uh one has been using mind studio for the last few months and have done already a lot of digital transformation they were an early adopter of AI so they gave all their employees access to chat GPT and mid journey and things like that uh they were an early adopter of copy Ai and Jasper and they've pulled all of that out and replaced all of that with custombuilt mind Studio AIS um and and so that's great but perhaps more importantly is last year they served over 2 million SMB with creative Services those are their customers and they are now tooling you know sort of tooling up for being able to take mind Studio AIS to these 2 million smbs is sort of as a as a new uh line of business spoiler alert no no it's not yeah that that would make sense too uhhuh thank you great question so the question is if now there's a new model comes out you know how long does it take I'm paraphrasing to get there uh about 15 minutes seriously this is a thing we do this this is our fun thing when new models get announced 15 minutes later we announce that we support the models and get people using that you can find it on my LinkedIn post by the way so I'm being told I got to go uh thank you so much if any of you want to find me on LinkedIn please do Dimitri Shiro and we can continue conversations there thank you thank you much [Music]
