our final demo of the day is kylin who will be giving a demo um from inworld AI on how folks are using llms to actually change video games and fundamental gameplay mechanics thank you kylin thank you so much it's been a crazy week GDC GTC gaming is hot right now um so uh I'm excited to show what I'm going to be sharing is actually a demo of an actual game that's kind of going live now so um just for a quick preview for those who aren't familiar um basically imor is a kind of endtoend vertically integrated platform specifically for gaming uh you know CJ was mentioning developers are hard to work with game developers are really hard to work with they are both technically Savvy and also extremely creatively want a lot of control so basically we have an engine that actually drives a lot of the experiences at runtime and it connects to anything like unre or unity and actually drives the behavior by taking in the game State and then putting that out we have a studio that actually is actually how you Craft um and augment existing game development using AI uh and we have a core solution so a lot of the challenges that I think lots of folks here are encountering games want to run locally they want you know no latency and all those kinds of things and so we're solving for that and what I'll be showing here today is actually mainly a demonstration of the engine component of that so we we this week launched with uh an experience with Nvidia a partnership with Microsoft and their Studios called project Explora and we released an early experience of a game U working with Ubisoft so I'll be showing a video of the Ubisoft soft experience so the main thing I guess is you know games have always been one of those places where people are super excited to apply AI but it's really hard because the controls that you have to put in place need to actually be beholden to what the narrative designers and writers of the games actually want to do and so in this video first you'll see sort of a conversational Dynamic where they've added on game design elements that are actually kind of making the dialog more engaging so it's not just a chatbot experience but it actually fits within what you feel like a gamer should be a gamified type of experience so we'll start with that and then we'll pause and I'll explain the next parts so what is this resistance when did it form like why do we even not like these Mega Corps like I like you know eating [Music] burgers I see okay our resistance has been around for years fighting against the oppression of these Mega Corps who exploit resources for their own greed plus with our sabotage missions we can provide a satisfying outlet for your skills while also fighting for a greater cause but enough about us what about your burger preference uh ah the classic case of burgers versus Revolution who needs Justice and equality when you can have a juicy burger instead time to re your priorities my friend well for me it's personal seeing my home and the world I love destroyed by their actions has fueled my passion to fight back but as a team we can make a a bigger impact and take down these corporations for good and who knows maybe we'll celebrate with some burgers after a success oh my gosh okay I love it Bloom absolutely love it let's do it that's what I like to hear insulting him okay welcome to the resistance Nelson let's make some history and maybe later we can grab some burgers and toast to a successful mission so a few things that I just want to point out here is because everybody here's very familiar with AI um the key things is you know of course we can do updates to emotional states relationship Dynamics all those things in the back end but what we realized for game Studio specifically is actually how we expose those as super important to kind of give the idea of progression because if you're just doing all of that in the back end they ultimately don't care so it's how we expose them kind of mapping that with game design is actually what allows it to come to life okay team the new drones in the air let's check out how Shadows does with this recon mission since it's your first rodeo don't be shy shoot any questions my way all right so Shadow the target is in sight but we H up any more guards show up let's hack that laptop and get out of [Music] here yes success the Drone has successfully hacked into the laptop and is downloading the map as we speak now we we just need to get out of there before anyone realizes what's happened watch out there's a guard watch out don't worry we got this just keep an eye out for any other guards and let me know if you see anything suspicious we're almost there hey Bloom how tall do you think that guard is around Oh no I got shot got that though around six feet that's pretty cool and uh so there as well because we're you know we have to use a lot of these models in parallel and so it's super challenging when you're putting together The Voice the multimodal input all those different things so large models don't necessarily work there and so it ends up being a series of a lot of models that are running in parallel to effectively process that then send the signals to the ultimate prompt so we've got and in this case you'll see the actual Dynamic game State as well so it's not just changing the character Dynamics but actually dynamically changing the actual game State Itself by triggering different things on the UI for the first step the only way to enter the building without triggering an alarm of any sort is through the window of the gallery on the second well for the entry point the best option is to access the gallery's window on the second floor from the outside but the obstacle is we'll need a ladder to reach it what do you think I don't know if that's the best option why do you think that's the best option because the other sides of the Villa are heavily guarded and monitored by cameras plus Shadows Intel showed that the guard in the L biggest threat we can't risk being seen or her so we have to be strategic any ideas I see that you got a a grappling hook why did you not decide to do that one that one looks pretty cool you know you're right that could work we could use the grappling hook to access the gallery's window good call Nelson let's go with that plan and a lot of what we're doing here as well is actually generating quests on the Fly and so effectively we're able to actually produce new quests that are dynamically generated based on the interactions that the player has and then basically grounding those in the goals that they have and so the fun of what we're building is we get to bring together basically everything that's you know consistently coming out and research but applying that with a user who has very specific needs and Creative Vision so yeah super fun check us out and if you're interested in games or or applying your Technologies to games as well we're always looking for partners thank you
