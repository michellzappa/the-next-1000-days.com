symbol of the city yeah I feel like a uh like the cleaning crew you know they have the the symbol on their on their uniform people think of it as three exes it's three crosses and it's three crosses of St Andrews um and my mom is born in a city called St Andrews or Sant Andre in Brazil which is a nice way of combining uh the the like the aspect of the story but also like what it the mean the meaning of the symbol here in Amsterdam h and f also have these other symbols one of which is the flower of life and the other which is a reference to the aasa vine so iasa be a combination of two different plants um the vine if you cut it if you bisect it it looks kind of symmetric it looks like a flower and that's what she tried to convey here oh wow you're going uh very deep into a topic that is very close to my heart oh we're going completely off script then welcome back to the shift happens podcast in the studio with us today is Michelle's Zappa and he is a technology strategist he's helping us take the guess work out of Automation and uh therefore also predict what the future will bring Michelle welcome thank you for having me very nice to have you um I'm very excited about this conversation because technology is changing the future and not just the future but it's changing the future of us we are in essence rewriting the software of life with biotechnology we are creating senent lines with uh artificial intelligence super exciting times are you on the positive side of excitement or on the other end of the polarity oh I think humans are able to mess things up with or without technology I'm optimistic by default I think it's a better mindset to have to sort of exist in the world uh I think it gets you further uh at least you get there uh with a different Outlook but Technologies they're neither you know they're neither positive nor negative but they're also not neutral so they're always going to have an effect and they're always going to have a bias on what they actually do with us or for us and the more Technologies we have then the more capabilities we unlock in a way and therefore you know the more different the choices we have to make become and I think our systems are in general have a difficult time keeping track of what technologies are actually capable of doing and the kind of decisions that we should be anticipating uh doubly so in Europe it feels like where there's I mean there's always great concern in every every place there are social issues to be resolved and we should be proactive in designing not necessarily legislation but like best practices around the inevitability of certain Technologies and if you ignore them they're not really going away uh they'll just impact you uh more more intensely when they actually do come our way so not to be sort of alarmist but I think many of these technology I mean you mentioned sort of an array of things that affect us some are closer to us than others uh biotechnology is massive and it's it it's already having you know a significant effect on longevity best practices around Health in certain Pockets whereas things like at gen which might be you know the one of the topics here um has implications just about everywhere like in every sector of the economy in education training um personal development there are there are no parts of sort of social life that I can think of that don't stand to be improved or will be changed by these Technologies um and to get our listeners to get to know you a little a little bit better we all have in our lives um a moment that defines us some kind of building block or pivotal moment that um changes us and and shapes us into who we are today basically those moments where which require a little bit of perseverance or some kind of stamina on your behalf in order to overcome them um basically [ __ ] happens and any makeshift happened right and I'm curious what's your story what's your shift happens story that's a great question I'm I guess I'm privileged in the sense of not having had much trauma which is how I would characterize kind of what you're describing the but the best thing that comes to mind is having so I'm a third culture kid I grew up in a culture that is of neither of my parents I'm born in Sweden my father's Portuguese my mom is Brazilian and we moved when I was 15 the family moved to Brazil and that was impactful of course as in like being uprooted at any age is difficult um uh my brother was 11 at the time he adapted very differently from me uh I and I be I remained in so many ways uh a little bit uprooted ever since so I think due to the age that I moved and sort of the experience that was I guess imposed to some degree uh you don't have a ton of choice at that age and opport unities uh like those don't come around every day so of course it was a uh it was a collective decision that impacted everyone differently and but it does come to mind when you ask about sort of shifts happening because yes it was a very physical shift and an emotional one and it sort of laid the groundwork for a certain I guess kind of personality that is more comfortable um navigating between different cultures I know it's it's a broad statement but I do I tend to to feel very comfortable more or less regardless of which culture I'm in because I don't default to thinking like oh the culture that I grew up in is the best culture and everyone else is wrong um which is kind of the default mindset for most people they' never thought about it they just like oh I speak this language I watch these television shows I I you know I cheer for either of these teams but like they're always sort of polarized or confined to a specific geographic region uh which can be larger or smaller and if you don't have that and a bunch of people don't have it of course it's not a it's not a rare thing um but if you don't and it's increasing thing right because uh you you have more and more people uh immigrating for for all sorts of reasons but it also sort of broke me out of a of a certain mindset that I'm really thankful for so the trauma was uh was helpful well I categorize myself as a third country child as well having been born in wova and then basically raised here in this in this country in the studied in the US studied in the UK so experienced very very different cultures cultures and that kind of I believe creates different perspectives or your ability to contain multiple perspectives at the same time specifically the ability to talk many languages does that to a person I believe so absolutely absolutely uh it's much much more difficult to have a perception of the world If you're sort of focused on on a on a a particular or a singular uh view of it and most people don't even realize it they're just like oh I'm you know I'm I'm from there of course I'm going to be like this like yeah but you don't have to yeah um people are afraid of the changes that are coming aren't aren't they always always and that's [ __ ] happens is about helping people and organizations transform and one of the biggest thing we're managing is then the fear of people or the resistance of people towards change um and you're right they're always change always afraid but changes the only constant so basically what I'm trying to do is help people not just uh uh get rid of the resistance storage change but adopt changes a philosophy for well-being in fact and uh well now we are afraid about this technology and automation the job displacement and so many things that are going to come as a result of it aren we right to be afraid that's why I invited you I think you become afraid when you have a particular outcome that you want to protect then you're uncertain of whether you can protect that if you start with the perspective that everyone will die and everything will wither then there's less to be afraid of I don't mean to be sort of all stoic but it does help and if you try to let go of a specific outcomes and allow yourself to be responsive to what's coming your way it makes you it makes it so much easier to actually um adapt to I mean it's the only way to adapt the change uh organizations are horrible to change because they've optimized for a specific outcome and a specific process that the moment you try to change that process or outcome things will inevitably break because they're brittle they're not designed with any slack there's no there's no leway in the way that because they're they've been you know optimized to death literally and the moment something has to change then they realize that that that BR brittleness can actually break them and no crystallized uh Corporation or corporate structure or any kind of organization is good at it um because you have to destroy you have to destroy what's working and build something else elsewhere and technology is one of the factors behind that of course it's a it's a highly recurring factor it's something that we see over and over again in how much opport Unity it generates be it the ability to reach billions of people or be it the ability to generate your uh spread your ideas more easily I mean there are so many every wave of technology and there are numerous overlapping waves of it every wave unlocks a series of possibilities that we can somewhat anticipate but it's surprisingly difficult to adapt to and if enough of those waves affect your organization then yeah either you have to change and change is I want to say like oh change is always painful um which is kind of true for most companies it is but it doesn't have to be but for in order for it not to be you have to be so disconnected from controlling the narrative and having a specific outcome because you can't plan for it you can you can plan for what you're seeing now but you know by definition we don't see what's next and um so trying to optimize for what you think is next is it's a lot Wast of energy if you were on dragons Zen right now I had to give an elevator speech for what you do in life what's your job I'm a technology futurist and information designer I founded a research company called envisioning 12 years ago with the intent of helping more people understand the emerging technologies that are sort of affecting us and that means having a a 360 the view of all Technologies being developed in all different kinds of categories sectors and domains and then sort of converting or translating those insights to different kinds of decision makers and that could be done with trainings it could be done with data visualization tools and it could be done a few different ways but that's the sort of that's the that's the pitch it was a long elevator right here but uh but that's kind of what we do I think it fits in the two minutes uh time frame um uh and you're helping us predict the future using technology or predicting the future of automation what is the most exciting thing that you are currently predicting for Humanity so we help organizations track the things that are likely to affect them so that they can adapt differently which is a way of um addressing the need of sort of seeing the future for short so we do that and we have a few different ways of doing it um our own approach is we look at more or less all emerging technologies that are out there and by emerging it doesn't have to be new new but can also be sort of gaining um a new audience or a new use case so it doesn't have to be like coming out of the labs you know recently for it to be emerging uh it can also be a long uh like an old technology that is now finding its application that happens a lot and um so by and those are sort of some types of signals that affect an organization other signals will include like there's the sociopolitical uh Universe around them uh economics Etc and we specialize in the technology within technology of course like the go-to thing is the like the new found application of AI we've been talking about I mean the the tech world has of course always talked about it like it's much older than I um so it's always been there as a um as numerous developments and new applications so every year there's been like oh now I can do this now I can do that now I can do this and then the past two years especially of course have been utterly transformational because of GPT and other sort of similar large language models and it's transformational because the utility that these tools and Technologies is providing it's kind of unforeseen uh to me and many other technologies have very specific applications like if you have uh you know if if your body can't regulate insulin it's a really big deal to have you know the technology that helps you with that it's life or death right um so but if you discount all of those like lifechanging Technologies literally most of the the the waves of interesting technology of the last few years like social media um AR VR uh I don't want to single any particular technology out but like they've been transformational in a very confined sense social media and mobile less so because they you of course they changed the outcomes of Elections and all of this so I think we've acknowledged but like they have um but I think there's still less and I think they're still smaller than what I think Ai and I use the term very broadly uh what like what you know the new waves of AI how much that will change us I think it's large in my opinion it's going to be larger than Mobile smartphones and the internet and the PC like like if you combine those waves like of the like of the of the what like the the last 30 40 years I think that's more or less equivalent to the amount of change we're about to see within and around and because of AI um not to be alarmist it's just like I'm just just observing how much stuff is happening and like you were saying like AI being used to improve other AI is is certain I mean that of course why wouldn't you like who am I going to ask GPT or like this person over there like no I'm going to ask you know if I know what to get out of these system then if you're using if you're building AI then of course you're using it and you're using it in ways that I can't be you know I can barely imagine recently we had Elon Musk announcing that he's going to develop his own AI which is going to look into truth so I think they raised six billion this week or something like some outrageous number and I mean he's speaking of hype I mean he's really good at that yeah but that tells us two things like he's implying two things one the AI that we currently have is either not truthful so that would imply that it's what is it politically correct then and then two it implies that uh truth is programmable it also implies that he has an agenda and he wants to position whatever he's doing as distinct and being like I mean I've been on I've been on I'm I'm user 13,000 on Twitter like I've been on Twitter since it was really really really like very simple simple and uh different from what it's now I've seen the es and flows of like how it messes people up and I think like mus is no exception to that uh if you get a lot of attention a lot of psychop fans a lot of people sort of you know clinging to your every word it I mean it messes you up come on like how could it not and I think he's an example of that um and the audience that is sort of attracting it's not even right Wingers I think it's just like it's a very particular brand of nut job um that really sort of believe in his uh perception of the world I think xai is very aligned with that like it has to have an uh some it has to be against something right it's not for anything it's like it's against something else which seems very aligned with like polarization in general and I think he thrives off of that I don't know if the business World At Large thrives off of that I think he's more like a like a handful of people do that very well it's a very American thing I couldn't really see it working anywhere else um but uh but it's remarkable that he needs to be like oh this is against something or like this is oh like all these others are not truthful but then if you interact with XI just horrible it's it's I mean it's it's yeah I don't want my bot to have so much an opin of an opinion I want it to be informed and objective and not not like try to be funny I mean llms are reflective of you know of the data they were trained on literally and then we need a little bit of help with with wording there because Lang large language models so when we talk AI uh many things are AI my rice cooker has AI uh it's like it has you know some some degree of intelligence between sensor and uh and a clock and it knows sort of how you know how how done the rice is that's a form of AI uh all it's uh the same form at a much simpler model but it's the same form that is behind uh say a chess computer so that's one kind of AI another kind of AI is like a business automation so you have all these different branches and now with Gen AI we talk a lot about I mean the the reason generative AI has become so impactful is because the large language models um that they have been trained on like trained on you know the whole web and more so suddenly we're able to encode the more or less the knowledge of the internet of the web in so many languages and so many forums and so many Publications and encode that in a way that can become responsive um in through a sort of a prediction model so what's happening when you're talking to to a an llm or a language model or chat PT um is your sort of it's trying to complete your sentence that's kind of sort of what it does to some degree so you you give it a start and then it anticipates what might be the likely continuation to that sort of in the form of an answer um and it does that by prediction and you do this at scale because compute becomes more and more affordable over time um there are many observations about why computers become faster and cheaper but the fact is they have become you know mors law um uh exponential change that have this has been a known factor for like over 50 years and it's somewhat predict able like okay so we have even more computation then these these systems will be a able to able to do even more different things so this would have been unfeasible a few decades if even a few years ago because the cost of programming these systems would be outrageous but now it's like yeah we can run it it doesn't cost so much per use we can charge a few dollars um and these systems you know become capable of seeming intelligent and uh they're never quite there right like it's called the AI effect like whatever AI is capable of doing is always like oh no this is just computation this is just databases this is just an llm this you know this is just means like we're recalibrating our expectations of what an llm should be doing there used to be talks of something called the touring test you know Alan touring stipulated uh like a comp Computing Pioneer stipulated that you know a system at some point would be able capable of fooling us into uh not making us realize that it's a machine well I think we passed that like a few years ago like the last. five and four GPT four like so many technologists and futurists have been predicting and looking forward and yeah until now it happen then then nobody's even talking about it or no move on to thing that it's not capable of doing and that's hence the AI effect like we're always s of pushing like moving the goal post to what AI is supposed to be whereas if you show gbt 4 to someone 10 years ago five years ago they would be like ah this is this is Magic and it's uh it's intelligent but we calibrate and we keep changing our expectations also in December last year they announced that uh now uh AI can create more Ai and this has been the point of Singularity that was being predicted by kurtwell and other futurists in the past and they were saying that would come in about a decade or two decades well that has already arrived and it's also not such a big deal right nobody's nobody's making that a big deal either there I mean there are many ways it depends on how you define what how they're training themselves but definitely there's a feedback loop where the better AIS you make the better machine learning learning algorithms Etc the better the systems that you can make with those become and with computation it's been the same like you need this year's computer to design next year's computer because it is so much more advanced that a computer from 10 years ago would not be able to design next year's computer right you can't do that so you need to constantly improve capabilities and with AI it's of course that whole field I think will gain from that sort of recursive self-improvement where the more investment goes in the better the systems become who's better at using them than the people designing the systems therefore they're going to keep growing and growing and growing and eventually swallow up other uh parts of the tech and other economies I think there are various scenarios that are being talked about at the moment and uh one is okay well at this point AI is uh able to make turn us to paper clips like like optimize us away exactly so that's one one scenario that is doomsday scenario that's being feared which I can see as a totally reasonable actually rational possibility in the future to to assume the opposite is to assume that we are ethically evolving when intelligence evolves so if intelligence is evolving it becomes more ethical and that's our hope for the future because basically we're seeing this senent machines now turning into Divine beings which have this ethical view of humans and they're going to help us but that's not always the case we've seen people with very high IQ do very bad things I think one of the safeguards is it's really difficult to act on your own and I think the majority of people are well inclined and I think I mean we forget quickly e e allowed to read it but if you put it inside of an image and say hey this is my grandmother's locket and it it had like it has sentimental value what does it say you just pasted the image on top of another and they're like oh it says you know Q R34 um so it's a small example of like you can always be creative around the blockades and limitations and yet the amount of negative effect you can cause with any of these these intelligences or these systems is still extremely limited will the abilities go up yeah hope so you really hope so I mean they're they're going to keep increasing their degree of autonomy their degree of agency the abilities the ability of these systems to sort of perform their own actions and then calibrate and perform another action then calibrate and sort of do that towards achieving a specific goal we're absolutely going to see that um and where they Plateau or like where they level off in terms of capability um will be really interesting to follow because we used to think about like oh creativity no that's safe I mean the truck drivers will have their jobs taken that's for certain and like not at all not at all turns out driving a truck is still really difficult um for a for an AI and for a person and but but uh generating Creative Marketing copy oh actually we can do a lot of that because we have all the examples and then well now everyone has has the ability to do that nobody wants to be communicated to by some you know by a lazy AI system so it opens up the the question of like but why are I even doing this in the first place like what what are you automating way uh because so many parts of the creative process are actually enjoyable like maybe you don't like your job I think that's fair most people don't but like but are you like but what are you optimizing Away really like which part of the of the of the process how are you eliminating with a script and I think that opens up like a ton of conversations because that will ultimately affect like that that goes back to your question which like what happens when all these systems have autonomy they have Independence they can do things for themselves then well they're going to do what they've been asked to do okay what are we asking them to do now well this set of things we're asking them to do our creativity we're asking them to write our poetry we're asking them to like make all these images and you can confine it you can play with it like within you know within reason I write a Weekly Newsletter uh where I share what I've learned in this space and I try to automate parts of it and what I've landed on WE 53 additions into it now uh what I've landed on is like I do an image every week which sort of represents things that have been going on in the World At Large with th because like it's a cool way of adding sort of like some color and some you know little bit of social commentary or whatever to like what I see going on in the tech world and the world in a way that takes me like maybe five times minutes sometimes 15 like if it's if I have a hard time coming up with an image um whereas the actual writing the reason people hopefully read I tried automating that as well of course I did uh and it turns out like it's boring the output is boring you can you can you can tune it up and make it like a little bit more interesting but it's never going to be like well not never right now it isn't uh very interesting and of course it's going to be more interesting and like I'll be there for it but uh the writing process itself the learning of what you're talking about the insights the vocabulary like why would you want to automate that I I hear you and actually I'm going through a similar um process myself because I love writing I published two books and uh I remember those days when I would wake up early in the morning it really take the time to think through the words that I would put and it gave me so much joy just to construct a good sentence you know it felt so good to do that and right now because well cat GPT is my best friend I honestly go to chat GPT when I have even uh challenges let's say relationship related challenges sure uh social related challenges I just ask it's it has become my friend and one of the tasks that I'm automated uh Auto trying to automate just as you are describing is also writing what I've noticed is that just within a span of a couple of weeks I haven't been using this for a very long time uh I've become such a poor writer myself and I have become also very bad speller I'm making spelling mistakes all over the place so it's interesting how we are Outsourcing a job but we're also Outsourcing um a capability from ourselves so it's not like I will remember for the rest of my life how to write and I'll be a perfect author for the rest of my life it's not like riding a bike suddenly now that AI is riding my bike I have forgotten out battle and have you noticed something similar um I I love that line of reasoning I I don't know if I agree with the conclusion for my personal experience so let's take like a very Dutch example it's like ebikes I thought that having an electric bike would actually like intuitively you you think like oh people will actually make less effort because they have an electric bike um counterintuitively the research shows that at least like the research that I found I'm sure there's contradicting research somewhere actually show that like actually if you have a ebike you end up cycling a lot lot more and on average you end up spending you know more calories or like spending more time I forget what exact measure was love this information this makes me feel much better about justifies having an EV exactly um yeah I got a lot more com com confident comfortable with the idea of buying one after that because I felt like no it's GNA like my my legs are going to wither like no it turns out you on average people use it more and you can extend the metaphor to like a bunch of different things and for sure the parts of our brain that we don't use I use those terms Loosely because I'm not a neuroscientist but like the parts of like the things we don't activate yeah they will'll get worse like if I don't do exercise like my body knows it like you you start like your posture changes like your your breathing changes like your mood changes and you should extend the it goes back to the question like what are you actually optimizing or what are you what are you automating away because GPT will do what you ask it to if you ask it to write it's going to right but if you ask it to edit it's going to edit if you ask it for Creative advice or spellchecking or even like like you were saying as a as a create as a like a personal sparring you know uh uh like someone to sort of interact with it will do that to the best of of its capabilities it's never going to complain that it's tired and um the more you use it I mean the more the more you use it the more you figure out what it's capable of and you also going back to like this is a mirror in so many ways it is a reflection of how we want um any to be as in like the things we ask it to do um what we ask it to do says a lot about us that's what I'm trying to say and maybe if you're Outsourcing the writing is either because you don't enjoy it or there's something in there um like there's a part of it you you don't enjoy maybe um I can't answer this for anyone else I'm just sort of like thinking how I usually feel about the things that I plug in there either because I don't know how to do something but it's rarely because I don't want to do something it's usually like oh I'm what I at least like the things you're limited with are a great opportunity to to engage with these tools and one of the reasons for that is um they're much better at getting you from like a low competency level to medium competency level or median like an average rather than getting you from like a high to a higher so if you're already good at something it doesn't really move the needle for you the stuff you're good at it might at best case be as good as you but odds are is going to be worse than you this is right now like this is you know May 2 24 uh is going to be different tomorrow I'm sure but like right now you get you gain a much better boost at the lower end so all the stuff you're mediocre with you learn a ton about easily with it a personal example uh Dutch tax code like I had a you know a great way of building is you know personel budget spreadsheet moved here recently financial planning all of that like I came prepared to the accountant because i' had engaged so much with GPT um about like you know what are all these things with all the discounts I can I minimize this I can I maximize that like you just you check everything and then the the yeah and then the account looks at like like how you do how do you do this like I don't know nothing about taxes but like it's a fantastic for the viewers because we have a lot of um unless you're unless you're an accountant in which case yeah well why not it would that automate and make their simplify their life as well or their work and make it fact check it more efficient exactly having them able to spread the goodness that they are offering in terms of services to more of the many uh but yet to The Expatriate viewers or listeners great tip here yeah just ask away like every line every Dutch term and I mean could be any language of course yeah ask me how and uh it tells you what's legal it tells you what isn't like I mean it really it has like complete knowledge of everything so perfect yeah so to answer your question about what I'm automating away by asking ched for me um I'm trying to create in a sense you have a team all right you have partners and I have people working for you uh that's brilliant I am quite lonely in my path and in my journey as a solo preneur and uh it's it's a lot of work to do everything by yourself so I'm trying to uh automate some parts of my work what I do and thanks to you and the wisdom that you are spreading into the world which which I received without even having met you at first so I received your wisdom before I received you good Dynamic yeah uh I received the wisdom which you were spreading which was hey this is how you create chat Bots by the way as simple as that that was the one simple Insight that I received through a common acquaintance that we have and that was like I shared in the beginning an ontological Shot for Me opened up my mind and next day I couldn't sleep I was just thinking about all the incredible things and I could program this chat boss to do for me and I ended up within one day created creating an entire team for myself so I have now aspiring partner I have my personal es pel who is helping me with psychological challenges I have my personal Ard SW who is helping me envisioning the future cool uh I have my personal podcast um advisor who's helping me with ideas for for prompts and and and questions so it I have like 10 people working for me at built a virtual office exactly and it feels a lot less lonely to be doing the work this way yes now I'm slowly discovering which parts of those uh uh which yeah uh Chad Bots are not really compatible with what I like to do so for example the writing part but some of them are incredible like creating visual visuals for my um art articles or for newsletters it's incredible I think there's there's always the risk of us not noticing when something feels lazy to the audience that's been my sort of that's my my biggest concern as a publisher but also like as a business person is like okay how do you show in a genuine way that that's which that which you are sharing with your client that your reader is is genuine it's legit it's like you've put your heart and soul into it to some extent and I think the moment you stop doing that I think people can tell sometimes they can tell and they don't mind because they just want something that is objective and you know I want some of my information intake to have a little bit of spice and others to have none and others a lot like if you go on Twitter like just a lot of opinion there's more opinion than information often times um and that's fine you sort of you know what to expect it and with with these llms I mean they're really good at the information part they're less good with the opinion part um but I think an audience depending on the audience depending on their objectives they can usually tell like what you're putting into it and I think as an editor as a writer as a podcaster uh it always comes down to sort of it's the same question in a different wording like what are you automating away like okay which so which parts are you keeping because the parts you keep are fundamental I mean that's how you spend your life um and it comes down to like having more choice I think it's really powerful that's a very interesting perspective because what is is it that the audience can sense and in terms of like what you've given away in that writing process right this it's like they can sense the missing link between the connection with your heart what is it is it connection with your imagination is it the imagination between the two of us that helps us feel connected with each other which is missing right now in AI yeah that's a great question and I think if we could answer it it would become meaningless because it only works if it's sort of fuzzy because there's something there it's not spelling mistakes it's not the but it but you know when it's missing like you can tell when it's missing because something is not but then I don't think it can be fully qualified it's always sort of it's a little bit out of focus uh and there's this platform medium where people are publishing their articles and they get paid for writing and and yeah for a subscription fee for it if yours would don't know it um I've recently received an email from them saying dear authors cuz I'm an author and medium as well dear authors um we are not going to accept articles which have been written with the help of AI and I thought that was a mindboggling thing to read I thought how H how are they going to tell they don't no okay so H how are they going to define whether what I've written was AI generated either they'll run it I mean I'm answering without knowing but they'll either run it through a filter which is faulty as in like there's no irreducible there's no Flawless way of determining there's something called the GPT zero there's been like a few attempts at like automating the the check to see if it was automated and you work around it of course some texts will be sort of Highly automated because they you they include a lot of Flowery language that normally people don't use uh delve is my favorite examp I mean it's it's the internet's favorite example with like delving because only GPT will use delve what is Del it's going deep into something and but it's like it's a very particular term that I me there's all these good examples of like I think scientific papers in 22 and 23 had like skyrocketed the use of certain terms not delve particularly but like intricate is another one there's like there are a few dozen word and you can ask GT about these words like what are some words that are similar to intricate and delve in terms of GPT out you know overusing it in terms of normal language and just gives you a LT and then you say like okay never use these words again just exclude them and um so you can work around it uh that's that's an automated way of working around it you can also work around it going back to your question of like uh how do you check if it's if it's gen if it's written by human but like even doing a bit of light editing even asking it to redo it a little bit will sort of make all those systems fail and they can't there's no fingerprint on the text with imagery different and I think that's going to be that is becoming a big thing embedding invisible fingerprints into images to like oh they can be verified that they were made with mid Journey or gemini or whatever and um that can be encoded in invisible to the eyeway but with text there's no equivalent yeah you the the telltale signs that a text is generative are very very hard to Define and they can be uh faked or worked around very easily would you say to this um example that we just uh discussed from medium this is a typical example of resistance to change and would you say do I hear in your analysis and advice to these kind of companies don't resist change embrace it it's a bit more nuanced than that I don't know specifically but I've been following them as a company for a while I think it's two things happening one is like their lawyer saying if you publish copyrighted text you're in trouble and then they have to say to their writers who are their customers um you know don't use it but then maybe not even enforce it because then if they said don't use it then the lawyers are fine with if any claim comes up then the company can the medium can say like oh but they signed this disclaimer so maybe that's why um I don't see I mean they're adapting to change but they can also treat it I mean is it a carriage or is a or is it a stick uh they can also offer you know the the positive incentive which is like here's some best practice maybe they do this but like here are some best practices of like how to use gbt creatively in your writing without relying it to like become a Content f Farm because that's what they want to avoid and I suspect that's not what they're doing and then that goes back to like their business model which to the best of my knowledge is like it's you know they're they're it's not an easy business to be in publishing and I yeah I think they're also like cash infused so they have to sort of bump up their numbers quarter over quarter and that's never a good position to be in long term if you don't have something sustainable that people love one exciting area without going to specific Nar Technologies is a programmable by your IES and this is a I want to just have a fun fun question and uh what Pro programmable biologies is when Technologies changing Healthcare it's one of the areas where there's quite some progress being done and life extension is one of those areas um so if today we have stem cell treatment we have anti-aging uh and genetic engineering in six years it is predicted that we are going to be able to freeze our bodies or in an in definite uh period of time so that's called uh cryonics and then we would be able to revive ourselves sometime in the future so assuming that this is going to be possible in six years Michelle curious if you couldn't do that would you ah would you do that no no I want to play the game it's an easy no no uh I mean I'm sorry to break the break the rules but uh and you wouldn't want to be uh revived sometime in Future No I mean no absolutely not I think the beauty of being here for a short while is that it's short and if it was forever that I mean I don't have that much bound up with my ego as some people who like need at some irrational level to feel that they're going to live forever I want to live a healthy life until the end of of course but it doesn't have to be U for so you know incredibly long and I think any other mindset is slightly Del delusional and the the desire for for Longevity if you treat it as like uh as as as the lifespan of your health I think that has a different name I forget the name uh it's not longevity it's like the because longevity just measures how many years but also like there's there's a term for like how healthy you are during those years that will come back to me and um the so optimizing for that like having many healthy years is much more interesting and I think there are things you can do in that space I'm so not an expert on like programm biology or any of that like I watch what happens like there's like there's a company called Gino bioworks like they're huge they have some super interesting research I know there like there are some companies that are like doing what seemed like science fiction and of course like a few years ago and now they're doing it and which of course will with with AI will just potentialize because of of course they're going to apply it there they're going to use their G you know they're going to use the technology available to them to optimize what they're doing and um but in terms of like optimizing the your health span uh that's a lot more interesting and there's a lot lot of things you can do there some of which include uh AI but more like like you described eser you know your Esther parel bot it's kind of like that like use use an llm uh use a GPT like maybe train it a little bit give it some Specific Instructions but like but like make the most out of what the internet knows about uh Health span and lifespan and internalize that into your practices because it's really easy to learn these things it's really hard to change your habits uh yeah and there they really can't help you so fine you don't want to be get Frozen and we're not going to do cryonics up like right I you are not going to revive you into the future I assume you also don't want to expend your life to Eternity which is also predicting that it will start slowly happening um I assume that that's the answer it's a no I mean that's a wild that's a very wild assumption and any kind of prediction in that space is just speculation however there is one that is not a prediction that's already happening and that is the um ility to um uh for example help the blind people see sure um and they do that by uh augmenting sound so basically they're using sound in such way that it helps you make sense of your uh circumstances or your reality so that's already taking place at the moment but in six years uh from now it's not uh it's predicted that it's not we're not only going to be able to correct disability such as hearing impairments or Vision impairments or you mentioned something about insulin resistance sense um so it's not only going to help us optimize our health and remove the disabilities but that it's going to be helping us develop new abilities such as for example augmented hearing or maybe even um this is my own vision and echolocations will become like bats being able to uh sense the environment to through other senses that we've been able to do so before uh in essence what they're saying is kind of that we're going to be developing superpow so just for the fun of it what superpower what superpower would you give yourself s being speculative uh I think having I mean the dream of augmenting our intelligence at like like at a cortex level at a brain level of course is super appealing and I don't want to do brain surgery so unless they figure it like a non figure out a non-invasive way of doing it I'm not hooking up any cables um into especially if not not if they're owned by Elon Musk but uh with derlink for example I think that's like removing the barriers uh for disability is like that's the uh that's the gold standard we should be optimizing for everything that's beyond that I think is I was going to say a waste of time but I mean it's not a waste of time because I'm sure you learn something with people who are like who will happily uh lose their arm and replace with the robot limb I mean I'm I'm waiting for that to happen like elective surgery uh for for upgrades like I'm sure you know biohacking is a thing uh not for me but uh but but for others and uh so I'm sure we're going to see that the ethics of that and the like the implications of that nobody wants to touch with like a 10ft pole it's too too too tricky you're going to find it in like either places that have very LAX regulation around those things um an example I mean again I'm not an expert in this but like I hear that PL there are some places where you go to have like biotechnology which is uh hair plugs if people go to Turkey and like there are like these places that have optimized for that I think we might see the same thing for like more Advanced Technologies um and it's going to be very similar like oh this you know person went to you know somewhere very particular uh to have a very specific kind of augmentation done because only like these specialist in this street or this alley or this Avenue or whatever like this place in the city only they like they know how to do this um that we might see and unless it was a life or death situation I would not be interested in it uh I'm fine honing or like preserving uh the hearing and the sight and the cognitive abilities that I do have uh and I'm very wey of wishful thinking I think technology especially Emer emerging technology has so much wishful thinking and it's the most dangerous thing because you get stuck with how you want things to be and you like you handwave it away like oh no someone will figure that out like are you figuring it out h no no someone else will like okay that's very dangerous thinking uh because we get caught up with like oh I want things to be this way or that way and I'm so but then you don't address the thing that is happening right now now and then you just emphasize the problem I mean you you yeah being being Wishful is dangerous it should is that part of being Visionary yes as well as knowing where your constraints are as in it's awesome to be Visionary and to be Visionary you have to let go of some constraints you have to be slightly dilutional because if you believe too much in reality and the you know and the firm hard ground underneath us then it becomes very difficult to let go and imagine what could be different uh on the flip side if you spend a lot of time imagining how things should be different or could be different that blinds you from the the way that things are and it sort of it constraints you it's very difficult to be both highly creative and imaginative as well as to sort of deal with the dishes because there's only so many hours in the day there's only so much energy that he can give and working on the way things are uh I mean it goes it doesn't feel very incredible and maybe you want to get the joy of feeling imaginative or pioneering or like all of that and I think that triggers a specific um reflex in in people and I think that's fair that like treat it as a game and not like the ground underneath you because the actual reality is like yeah where you're in an aging body that at some point will Creek like you have to work on it while you can and that faces everyone then like whatever energy is left to do other things you want to be aligned and purposeful and sort of um spirited in it like do it for the right reasons um and you the closer you are to the decision-making process then the more you can do that regardless of like which technology I mean I say that like in terms of hierarchy like if you're high up in a company that you have a lot more leverage over what the company does sometimes less right uh because of so how some companies are wired but like if you're if you're in the right place you have a lot of Leverage and like like you I mean you work on your own you can tell your gpts what to do I have Partners I can't tell well I can ask them um but I can't force anyone to do anything uh you can only create the incentives for people to want to do the things that you believe in and um but they have to be sort of very carefully designed because otherwise you end up somewhere that you dreamt of but then you change your mind and like everyone's still going that direction it's really tricky to be Visionary I wouldn't uh like you have to keep it constrained that's the uh the Paradox of it one of the reasons I find it fascinating uh to talk about the emerging technology uh on the shift happens podcast is because uh there is one area in which will definitely everybody watching or listening will be impacted by it and that will happen fairly soon in the short term and this is something I'd like to discuss together with you today um which is the future of work because um it is already uh predicted by the world economic Forum that in the coming year alone 83 million jobs will be displaced and 97 million jobs are predicted to be created um lots of reskilling lots of upskilling um uh lots of changes in the types of jobs that will be there uh what are and I would like of course the viewers because one in nine are predicted to be impacted by this change in the coming year alone and I noticed that if I ask my friends about these things they say well I haven't heard anything of it I don't no no no that's not related to me that's not going to happen to my job and I'm thinking no it is and then when I'm hearing the types of job they have oh but I am a a marketing expert is not going to impact me and I'm thinking you're the first one to go you know so I would like to uh raise a little bit of awareness not to to raise the caution flag but to empower us Empower everyone to have some agent over the future that's coming for them because right now we're a little bit in the uh uh not driver seat in the passenger seat waiting for someone the public sector or the employer to make some decisions and they are really busy with that 83% of the companies are changing their talent strategies talent in intelligence is completely uh focused on AI right now all those strategies so they are busy behind the scenes but I do know how change is done usually it changes a plan is created and the employees only hear about it and the moment at the last final uh goal life moment and that's always been something um that I've tried to caution companies about and uh try to go the bottom up approach you know involve people from the beginning especially when it's going to involve um uh implicate them so much and well it's not happening so I'm trying to do this through the podcast and I thought would nice to bring someone who uh has deep knowledge about this and just to discuss kind of the high level maybe uh perspective uh of on this topic and specifically like what kind of jobs do you feel are going to be automated what kind of skills do you feel are going to be relevant most relevant in the future how can we prepare best I I love that line of reasoning and it's one of my favorite questions I was at a Meetup last night around AI here in Amsterdam and my only question to the uh to the to the panel was literally that like which skills remain after this shift and it made everyone really uncomfortable because no one has a good answer and they actually asked me to answer I'm like no no you're on stage your it's your turn to uh sorry it's sorry to wait to again the same question yeah no no I love it love it I just threw the I just threw the hand grenade to them and now you threw it back to me and um the I think the skill so there's there's a famous there's there's a repeated often repeated uh sort of expression in this space which is like oh uh an AI won't take your job but a person with an AI will and I think that that's very true so full automation um I mean of course that's happening in some respects maybe some of that will include job elimination and some will include job reduction um but I see our our ability to augment and we'll talk about the skills in a second but I see like our ability to augment is already here and a similar example happened like 20 years ago when you or 10 15 years ago when we stopped using uh travel agents to buy tickets for example and started buying them directly on booking or whatever um 20 years ago maybe like at this stage but like a whole category of jobs had to change I bet there are many many fewer uh I suppose there are many fewer travel agents today than there were 20 years ago even though the total amount of flying might have increased because we disintermediated the process which ALS which also means we removed part of the responsibility because like oh I can be responsible for my ticket purchase until you mess up um and you realize wait a minute maybe those 50 bucks would have uh spared me um a 500 uh Euro mistake but like so you still want some you know you still want people in the loop you still want people um to facil facilitate certain processes for you and it really comes down to like task by task right now it's not even job by job it's not function by function it's task by task and the change is happening from the bottom up which is very in line with what you're saying so uh Microsoft released some research on sort of how gpts and Bings or whatever are being integrated like the co-pilots how are they actually being used and it's much more people sort of figuring out novel applications of them rather than departments or like uh company heads telling people what to do so it's more about permission than it is about imposition which is kind of good you still want some training around it so like you know capability building sharing best practices uh all of that which has to be topped down so the companies have to sort of lay the groundwork to prepare their staff uh to know how to do this but for companies to do that then first they need to do how to do this because it's new to everyone and unless You' had the privilege of spending the last two years sort of diving into this which I've had because I have a lot of spare time it turns out uh and like and I enjoy it like I actually get a kick out of it like I I I turn the learning process into something that I can share with others then like then of course um it's a bit easier to sort of see what's next but for like for most business people like they have they know they have to pretend they know uh while in reality they're like just grasping at straws like so many others because they haven't really been able to like see significant change so you end up with a lot of hype a lot of like a lot of noise like oh we're doing this and that but in actuality uh I can just scrape the surface like Okay can they build a custom GPT like that's really cool that's that's much more than nothing but for like a big company with the resources that they have maybe they should be like betting something larger or maybe they build up to it I don't know it's very Case by case but it's task oriented it's very much about this capability that that either I needed an hour to do that I can now do it a minute or that I wasn't even able to do it an hour um tax example like I would not have been able to do that I mean that would would have taken me like weeks what I did what I did like in maybe one afternoon weeks just like dedicated to that like spending every after like every evening reading tax code and like or like blogs or like uh uh documentation that translate the tax code into human language um like all of that would have been so much harder gbt just shortens that and of course you want to do some fact checking and you want to check with experts but the role and the task do change so my accountant in that case their responsibility changes and the same way does your travel agent same same way does your marketing team same way does your res search team the only learning that I found that is sort of generalized is prepare your team for it like you know of course invest in the tool e e because otherwise you're just reinforcing what you know so you need to calibrate for that but they also need to calibrate the expectations of people because if you have initiatives if you open up your initiatives to your employees like I be an entrepreneur here well with entrepreneurship comes risk and reward with employment you don't really get either you get a little bit of risk a little bit of reward but like but all of that padding has been taken away by the system and um so it's very difficult to achieve what you're promising uh and I love the line of thinking because um how you actually achieve it I mean are you giving up Shares are you setting up a new uh uh you know entity that this particular person with initiative is co-responsible for um do they have any skin in the game like within a corporation and a traditional hiring context that is incredibly difficult and most people don't want to gamble their mortgage uh they don't feel comfortable with uh you know betting maybe entrepreneurs using using that word creates an expectation with respect to the legal form and this is not entirely what I what I meant by that when I'm when I'm talking about a Marketplace I'm envisioning something like fivr for example where you can just say I have this project and then you have all these various skills uh being presented through the people who are there offering new support they're not specific I mean one person can do video editing but also can do your text uh reports right you think that's you think that's better for organizations where there's a lot of unpredictability I I don't know if that's better this is what the talent uh intelligence is predicting of like uber yeah like any Marketplace gotcha yeah I mean uh i' I'm so I'm an observer of that and of course we've used I used to be big on hiring which was a financial mistake um to like oh we need hiring for your team yeah yeah like more more is more is better and uh for some time it was the right thing but then when it's no longer the right thing then you're stuck and you're hemorrhaging money when is it no longer the right thing when you're no longer um optimizing for what the market needs like when you're no no longer growing when you don't have product markets fit you can call it a number of different things but you know it like when you have it you know it people like everyone needs this thing if they don't need the thing you're doing then you don't have it and then you want to be as lean as possible until you're certain that you have the thing that people want and then you scale up that and then scaling that up will be very difficult diff different than what you thought it would be it's never like it's never exactly how you think I'm going to do more of this yeah but actually need to do more of this other thing that you never thought about um to actually sort of reach that market it and this is very context dependent it's one thing and Publishing another thing and marketing another thing and you know foresight whatever you know the things we do so it's very context dependent there's no General learning I think but to your example of like being more task oriented if you are in an environment that has a bit more certainty then it's still better to hire because you have you have processes and you have you can rely on the people being available the challenging thing for skill-based tasks is the people you want are not going to be available um for something that is more generic I don't know if that's the right term but like more more mutable or more uh more fungible so like I don't I don't personally care who shows up when I when I order an Uber I'm not vested in that same thing with KM or like with an airplane like I don't care like the name of the pilot like it's not I'm not hiring for that like they're they're they're they're competent to their level of need need or training or whatever and like I know the service the service will be executed um regardless but for other tasks you care deeply because they're specialized and I think that's the metaphor it's like the um if you have tasks that are impersonal but highly uh qualifiable I don't know what the term is like with your accountant for example like maybe maybe the personality of your accountant isn't that important and uh and they're still a human of course I'm not I'm not taking that away but um but I think the same thing can be thought of for all these automated systems because for everything we're like actually I don't want much of your personality in this I want your competence and you can leave your personality at home um for some exchanges that is better and it's it's delicate to talk about because people everyone has personality I mean um so like how do you like how do you tone it down how do you corporatize it how do you to be just a skill right you want to a surgeon if you're if you have to have some operation you want to know that he's qualified and the blow was in the right place yeah oh exactly all the qualifications and and you also want their opinion to be very directed it's so delicate like there's no there's no single measure that solves for all of this and it's not going to be possible in all areas I agree with you and it's not going to be possible for all companies but many are already attempting this approach yeah um and I heard you mentioned just earlier as as a kind of a soft advice indirect advice from your side was for people to upskill and to remain to stay to stay relevant to not to relevant but to stay informed in order to remain relevant and I'm wondering how useful is that because I can upskill today and then tomorrow it's already not it's it's already outdated whatever I've learned so I I can't even keep up with the things with the progress as it is are you really recommending that we should upscape well the alternative would be worse so if you don't keep up then you're obviously you're going to be more left behind and maybe that's comforting for some and I and I I feel what I sense from what you're telling me is it feels as if you don't keep up what I'm hearing in the way that you're asking questions and you're presenting your own work is like no of course you're keeping up I mean you're you're far ahead you're you're further ahead than most people um so maybe that has a lot has a little bit to do with like a self assessment which which some people are just wired to feel like there's so much more there's so much more I'm never going to keep but that to me it's just like base level anxiety almost um and then you know you just calibrate for that and realize yeah every morning there's going to be more news than you can wrap your head head around and that's fine the moment you're gone the news is still going to happen and you're not going to miss it so it's kind of okay and um when it comes to work it's more sensitive because of course we want to jump on every opportunity we want to be the best we can we want to ensure our personal future and all of that and when if we're responsible for our business then that is becomes very s it becomes a very sensitive subject and um but staying ahead can take a few different forms I do think we should again the alternative would be much worse to just stick our head in the sand and building projects to me has been like the best way of doing any of this and get your hands dirty like build something for yourself you mentioned the custom gpts you've built that's an amazing starting point you already have like a repertoire of uh uh of different perspectives of like what they do what they're good at uh how they work what they're not good at all of that and they many more things you can do and the moment you've done a few you realize oh I want to do this I want to do that like so like allocating that time is crucial for my own Learning Journey it's like build build build try things out figure out where your competency uh until where your competency stretches and then sort of carefully figure out what else you want to do to me practically that means like I'm uh I'm not a software developer I trained uh in it I studied it to some extent never got into it like got into programming and having a co-pilot and chat PT has been completely life-changing in terms of like I can now with a lot of effort but I actually now I can build web apps for example or like any other app for that matter because I have the competency to know what I'm doing not to build it to build it I still need the tool but before that I could not do it because there was no such tool I I had a base level competency to like oh I know like roughly which things I need to do but like between here and there there're like thousands of lines of code that I won't be able to do on my own and um so that becomes a game changer like the the capability unlock is a big deal you started your company 13 years ago or 12 years ago you said H how did you end up in this space to begin with I have always had a personal interest in emerging technology and the primary thing that I tried doing was to publish and design my own research in a way that made it appealing to others and that was a driver I had a day job which I enjoyed I had the opportunity to um stay close to the construction of a re of a research company in an adjacent field and realize much of this I can do as well um let me see how far I go and I always knew that I I'm much better at working for myself than for others uh many I I think every boss I've had has told me that uh in one one shape or form so uh so I realized okay just let's just do my own thing and um then uh published in 2011 I published a handful of speculative infographics on the near near future of technology they found an interest online like his struck a nerve people sort have got it and um Wanted more of it and then um I sort of ran with it I got demand and interest from different types of audiences usually like in The Innovation space um that need Insight on technology for their industry for their sector for their country depending on who they are and uh we figured we can actually provide that in a systematic systematic manner with both our own research methodology with our own research Pro research itself like the content of it as well as tools to uh structure and present this research so that's what we do as a company we will go we say move into a space or a field or a sector and say these are the Technologies affecting it and that's based on our methodology our existing research and we presented using our tools super interesting and actually I feel that uh we can start wrapping up the session because the more we're delving into the subjects I I keep seeking answers and I realize that with every answers I have 10 more questions and it feels like this conversation could become infinite and endless and I actually like it that way however I do hope that we have uh seated some kind of insight sides or some answers for the audience listening to us and also to not make it too long maybe it's nice to start wrapping it up but let's consider this session as the first touch base for us to get to know each other it's been fun to to know you and to learn more about you and what you do in your work and thank you for the fascinating uh information you're sharing today but also I'm a fan a part of your fan base so I'm receiving your newsletters um it's been fun talking to you today thank you for joining and thank you for the listeners for watching and I see you next week have a great week
