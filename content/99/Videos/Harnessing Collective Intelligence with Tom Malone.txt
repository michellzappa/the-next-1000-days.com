[Music] hi i'm gary hamel and i'm here with my colleague michaela zanini and welcome to the new human movement today again a really smart really special guest uh professor tom malone he's the patrick mcgovern professor of management at mit's sloan school he also is head of mit's center for collective intelligence and we're going to dig into that shortly i feel that in some ways tom and i have been on parallel paths tom wrote an early and very influential piece on internal markets i had my own take on that in 2004 tom wrote the future of work uh for seeing much of what we've been talking about in this in this series and and uh and also uh much of what i talked about in the future management uh tom's most recent book superminds appeared in 2018 and uh you know tom is one of those rare people who basically everything he says is new and it's important and i've had the chance to read and tom's been involved in various things we've worked on through the years together i guess tom one article we kind of uh i draw drew on your thinking moonshots for managers and harvard business review i would recommend our readers to that but tom thanks so much for agreeing to chat with us today it's a pleasure to be here gary great to see you again so let's kind of you know dig in uh superman's i was is an immensely thoughtful book and as i understand it your argument is that technology is allowing us to aggregate human wisdom human capability in new ways and maybe we're not really exploiting that you know very well yet but but you know talk to us about the promise of this and and how how are these new collaborative technologies going to allow us to do together what you know we we struggle to do alone so let me just start with the fundamental thesis and then we're going to drill down what what what this means for the future work the future of organizations uh but why don't you start with kind of your core your core take on all this tom great so i think the two key messages in the book superminds the first is that i think we're spending way too much time thinking about people or computers not nearly enough time thinking about people and computers too much time for instance thinking about how many jobs computers are going to take away from people and not enough time thinking about what people and computers can do together that could never be done before well that's the first message of the book and since that's kind of the straightforward message but there's a deeper message of the book that in a sense is about a new way of looking at the world in a sense this second message is about how to see ghosts now i don't mean real ghosts if such things even exist but i do mean powerful entities that are all around us all the time these ghosts are superminds which i define as groups of individuals acting together in ways that seem intelligent now by that very broad definition superminds really are all around us all the time and in fact almost everything we humans have ever accomplished wasn't done by individual humans working alone these things were done by groups of people working together often over time in space in various kinds of superminds now these superminds include hierarchies democracies markets communities and what i call ecosystems and so i think that vocabulary is a way of starting to think more systematically and more creatively about how people and computers and groups of people even if there aren't computers involved have all these kinds of super minds can do new things that we could never do before but that's in a few words kind of a summary of the whole book and so if i understand you tom what you're arguing with is like you know over the centuries as human beings we have found ways of aggregating human effort and intelligence as i said so we can do together what we can't do alone i mean clearly bureaucracy was a way of doing that you know if you look at henry ford bringing together thousands of people to create this immensely complex thing called an automobile right i mean what what we can do as a species is largely limited by our our capacity to come together and do things in new ways and and and your thesis is that technology is going to really immensely amplify that i guess you know so far in our lives you know we we see email that kind of connects us together now we see things like slack and kind of projectware microsoft team zoom and so on but i but i think you have some examples or at least you have a vision of this that is that is more profound than simply you know bringing us together in conversation or uh allowing us to share calendars and documents maybe give us a a sense of of of of what's your aspiration or what's kind of a bleeding edge example of of bringing people together using technology to do some fairly complex or amazing things well let me start with something that's not exactly bleeding edge everybody knows about it most people use it every almost every day and that's google think of google just the search part of google not the other things they do now too but the if you think of google it's a whole system it's not just google the company it's millions of people all over the world creating all kinds of knowledge and making it available on the web and then the google search algorithms kind of integrate and search that knowledge so that when you ask a question of google the answers you get often seem amazingly intelligent at least a certain sense of intelligence so that's just one example i think of how people and computers together can do something that would never even remotely have been possible if you were having humans doing all that searching all the time and in fact even the algorithms would be of no use unless there were also millions of humans out there generating the content to be searched so we could do lots of lots of examples but that's one to start with you know let me share something which is i i came across a really interesting example that kind of surprised me tom i'm going to see if i can put it up here on the screen and we'll find out because i'd love to get your comment on this this was something that was done a few years ago i think 2017 by reddit and uh they put up this they ran this little collaborative experiment which i thought was very cool i think it took place just over 72 hours but they but they put up a screen that i think was uh um i want to say it was maybe was it uh a thousand by a thousand pixels right or or something like that i'll forget but but basically it was like this but only amplified and any user could come in and you could change you could click on one pixel and change the color from and like they had 16 different colors but once you change that you couldn't change it again for a matter of minutes so i couldn't just come in and construct an image i could come in can you know change the pixel one color and then i was locked out for a bit well they ran this over 72 hours and what happened was communities of people on reddit started to get together and and and and coordinate these little individual pixel clicks it was it was called our place by the way if you want to go look that up on on reddit but what they ended up with was this right so a team says well let's do the mona lisa let's do the american flag let's do the rolling stones logo whatever it is but i think if you said hey we're just gonna let people come in one at a time change the color of one pixel you would have had a hard time imagining people would spontaneously figure out how to collaborate you know to do to do to do something like that so is that the kind of thing you have in mind sure that's a that's a great example in a sense that's that's kind of a toy but i think there are all kinds of much more serious work that can be done in dramatically new ways when we can coordinate people in the ways these technologies make possible and an example or two would be what so one example would be hyperspecialization that's an example of a concept let me give you a couple of examples of it imagine that well we've already seen examples of that in things like medicine where doctors for instance specialize in very small parts of medicine we've seen it in physical work in factories for hundreds of years but i think as technology makes it cheaper and cheaper to communicate all over the world and faster to do that as well we're going to see lots more hyper specialization in knowledge work not just physical work so uh think of the task of making slides for instance today lots of relatively highly paid and intelligent professionals spend a lot of their time fiddling with bits on their slides to make them look good imagine there were a service where different people who specialized in different parts of slide preparation could do a lot of that work for you you might kind of do a rough draft of some ideas and some people would clean up the grammar and somebody else would clean up the colors and the logos and all that stuff and each of the people who do that would be really highly specialized in doing the exact thing they did so they could do it faster and cheaper than anyone else and uh i think it's easy to imagine something like that being much better than the way we do it today it's also easy to imagine computers doing some of those things too not all of the hyper-specialized work would be done by people some could be done by computers another example of that might be in the legal field right now a lot of time of legal associates is spent doing research to find things that other lawyers other judges etc have said all over the country say but imagine you had people who were highly specialized in very specific kinds of legal questions imagine for instance there was someone who spent their whole life mostly thinking about what are the rules of evidence in murder trials in the state of texas or whatever the specialized example is so you can imagine that people who do that would be able to answer almost all the questions you've ever thought of almost instantly they don't have to do any research like the junior associate would have to do they just know the answer or can find it very very quickly so even though they could charge much more per hour than the associate who's scanning all these things to find the answer the first time it might still be much cheaper to you the lawyer who needed the answer than paying somebody else to do it in the traditional way so technology you're saying tom if i understand is a it allows it it allows me to specialize exactly where i can add the most value it could connect me to a global market of individuals for whom my expertise will add value um and and it also allows you to aggregate the various bits and pieces of that expertise that you may need for example to build your case as a lawyer is that kind of what you have in mind here exactly that's one way this can be done another way you can think of this happening is not just hyper-specialization but much richer coordination think about the process of designing an automobile traditionally when we coordinate that in a kind of hierarchical way of bureaucratic way you know different silos of the company design different parts of the car you know somebody's designing the tire somebody else the engine or the seat or whatever and there's managers at higher and higher levels that say oh well uh this looks okay this doesn't quite work because somebody else over in some other silo is doing something that that's not compatible with that but you might not find that for days or weeks or months until it gets to the right level in the hierarchy where the conflict is discovered imagine instead you could have all kinds of direct connections between the engineer who was working on designing the seat and the engineer who was working on designing the cushion for the seat or whatever it is so they could be continually modifying their plans each sees what the other is doing talking directly to each other as needed that's the kind of thing that happens sometimes today but often kind of by chance if you're in a real bureaucracy you can imagine much richer kinds of connections like that that the technology will make not only possible but cheap and easy to do because what you're really describing and and i think i think we see the early you know the early uh kind of shadow of this tom and i i want to come back and and and and get you to to kind of tell us you know how far you how much progress organizations are made on this but what seems to be happening is we're moving from an organization we're primarily vertical uh which which is an artifact of a time when when when information communication was very expensive so you'd have 10 people report up to a boss who would aggregate their information and that that manager tried to solve the coordination problem uh uh but you're describing organizations becoming much more lateral where where a lot of that that coordination collaboration is happening you know laterally across the community rather than where we're relying on on managers to to to to to to manage the linkages and so on and clearly you know we we do have t tools now like slack that help us do that but but if if you think this is an inevitable evolution towards flatter more more lateral organizations how far along are we in that process do you think and if you look at the existing technologies are we going to need a lot better tools or do we have pretty good tools already great question in fact you in the first part of your question there you kind of summarized one of the main arguments i made in my book on the future of work which is that the reason we have so many hierarchical ways of coordinating things today is because hierarchies turn out to be a really good way of coordinating things when communication is possible but still pretty expensive before the communication was even possible like when we had hunting and gathering bands you couldn't even communicate with somebody on the other side of the country or even the other side of the mountain you could only talk to the other people who were right there next to you in your little band or tribe when it becomes possible to do that longer distance communication then it becomes possible to coordinate things over much larger groups of people but still fairly expensive if you have to communicate by sending letters on horseback or by carrying them or even by using expensive telegrams you still can't afford to do much of that communication and so the best way of coordinating large groups when you've got present but expensive communication is to bring a lot of the information to a single point where the decisions can get made and orders sent out to the people who need to carry them out and i think it's therefore no accident and it's it's actually very smart that many of our organizations the ones we've all kind of been raised in for the most part use this hierarchical form because it's a smart way of doing things when you've got expensive communication communication gets cheaper though it becomes economically feasible for essentially everyone to talk to everyone it becomes possible to not just coordinate at the top but coordinate laterally all over the place and that's i think something that has happened to a dramatic degree in the last few decades i mean just i just have to ask one follow-up there though i want to clarify anything because the the the role of that leader was not only to aggregate that information but was then to make sense of it and and and act and one of the questions i think maybe a lot of people have had is as we see organizations becoming more lateral and you have kind of many domain communications like how does order come out of that how does consistency come out of that and and and and you know when you have everything connected to everything how do you get to the point where there's some alignment and and there's a decision and you get to some consensus and the organization is moving forward in in in a coordinated way rather than just having you know i mean at the extreme you have you know you have you have like social media and it's just you know it's just a kind of chaotic set of conversations very densely connected but it doesn't really lead anywhere so you have a thought on yeah absolutely so basically i i left out this part as i was summarizing it a minute ago but you're absolutely right that the people who have access to all this information in a lateral way still still have to make decisions so each person in their own part of the organization has to make their own decisions somehow instead of just following orders from someone above them in the hierarchy but if they have access to all the information needed to make a sensible decision then they can do that themselves instead of waiting for the boss to tell them what to do so in order for that to happen you actually need two things the first is these people have to have the information the second is they have to have the incentives that will lead them to use that information to make decisions that don't just benefit them personally but that benefit the organization as a whole so one of the key aspects of designing these decentralized organizations it's true in any organization but especially important in these decentralized ones is to design not only the communication structure but also the incentive structure so if i'm if i'm incented perhaps by just contributing as much as i can to corporate profit if i do a task that for which the profitability can be measured then that may be a lot of what you need to do to incentivize me properly tell me i want you to maximize profit and you can use all this information to help you figure out how to do that go to it and if everybody does that then you kind of maximize profit for the company as a whole you need some rules about things you can't do probably and you may well need ways of helping all these more decentralized decision makers come up with coherent plans but there are a lot of ways to do that in fact one way that i know you know about but a lot of people don't often think of it this way is with markets as opposed to high risks so when you have a market whether it's an internal market within a company or an external market between companies that gives you a lot of the structure you need to get coherent action so if if you and i gary both have an idea about how to do something but they're different ideas we could try each of us to do our own idea but if if if you can convince michaeli and hundreds of other people that your idea is better then i can't convince anyone that my idea is better better enough to buy from me or from them then their idea wins without some boss telling us it was kind of like the market demand that makes the decisions so mark as our particular our particular version the sort of market we see like as as maybe a kickstarter that's that's a certain type of a supermind then right you have all this intelligence coming together to make judgments about what looks like it's a great product or likely to find a market and what's not exactly right so market is one type of supermind and that's one reason why i think this supermind concept is useful because it gives you this set of five types of super lines that you can think about how each of those might be useful in a particular situation and the 5r tom i don't think we just went through that little taxonomy yeah i think i said it really quickly but i'll say it again if i didn't say it in this conversation it was in the one before but i think it was in this one so the first type and the most obvious type of supermind is hierarchies so where group decisions are made by delegating them to a specific individual in the group the second type of supermind is democracies where group decisions are made by voting third kind of supermind is markets where the group decisions are essentially the combination of all the individual pairwise agreements between buyers and sellers the fourth kind of supermind is communities where the group decisions are made by a kind of informal consensus based on shared norms and reputations now all four of those kinds of superminds require at least some amount of cooperation for instance in a market you may be competing with other companies say but you have to at least cooperate to the extent you're using the same kind of currency and following laws and things like that so they all require some kind of cooperation but when you don't have any cooperation you have what the fifth kind of supermind which i call ecosystems where the group decisions are made by the law of the jungle whoever has the most power gets what they want and the survival of the fish so so those those types of superminds i wouldn't claim that's a complete taxonomy of all kinds of groups in the world but i think it's at least a very comprehensive taxonomy that encompasses most of the things we see in the world around us i hope you're enjoying the conversation and i just wanted to take a moment to thank heyer for underwriting the cost of producing this interview hire is the world's leading appliance company and also a global leader in the internet of things for the last decade hire has been leading a remarkable revolution in management it has proven that even the largest most complex organizations in the world can be entrepreneurial at their core now back to our conversation one question i i wanted to uh probe on is is hierarchy uh as a supermind right in most organizations since we operate as bureaucracy kind of over index on that right and and probably the area where that is most obvious is around setting strategy and direction right because we just assume that it's the responsibility of people at the top maybe with the help of some consultants to make sense of the world and then and then say here's how we're gonna you know tackle opportunities and challenges right that we face and and i think you you talk about that in your book and in an article that you wrote for the uh mit sloan manager review that you know this kind of approach kind of insular top-down approach just leaves a lot of value on the table and that's why you end up with strategies that aren't very differentiated from from competitors and and with a lot of employees who are just not really understanding what the strategy is because they haven't been involved in and they're just communicating this high-level vision that doesn't really make a lot of sense to them so and and you and i think you you offer a very practical kind of thought experiment for how a large company might you know tack use some of these other superminds and and technology to completely reinvent the strategy process and make it much more open and and uh and bold and and and and uh powerful so could you could you help us kind of talk about you know if you were hired by uh procter and gabble and ibm and so on to help them think about reinventing the strategy process to take take uh take a take you know to harness the collective intelligence of everyone working in those companies what would you tell them yeah so great you're referring to the example i i used in super minds and in the slow management review article the um and we i said it in the context of procter gamble not because procter gamble is actually doing this but because it's something they could do and because they've talked a lot about how they did strategy before uh to think about this let me introduce one other set of key concepts from the superminds book which is not just the types of superminds as we talked about a minute ago but the cognitive processes that any supermind must carry out in other words any in fact any intelligent entity whether it's a person or a group or a computer has to do five kinds of things they have to decide what actions to take they generally have to create options for what those actions could be they can usually do those two things better if they can sense the world around them and if they can remember the past and if they're really smart they can learn to do all of those things better and better over time by learning from their own experience so we've got decide create sense remember and learn are the five different cognitive processes let's use that framework for thinking about how a company like procter gamble could do strategic planning and in particular how they could do it in a much more open way involving many more people than just a few senior executives and maybe some consultants and so forth so let's start with how they could create options for their strategic plan imagine instead of just depending on the the people in the room around the board table to come up with ideas you could let anyone in the company come up with an idea you could say if you're in in this business unit and you're interested in a particular product what's an idea about how that product could be done differently how we could price it differently how we would market it differently or whatever and maybe what's an idea for a new product we might sell so anybody could be coming up with ideas like this uh and you could have competitions within a given business unit say or actually within a given product let's say for which of those ideas or which combinations of those ideas were most promising you could have the existing executives judge those competitions if you wanted but it might be interesting to have some kind of voting or other kind of decision making process for that you can also imagine this happening at multiple levels for instance you could imagine one set of competitions for each product or potential product what's the best strategic plan or set of strategic plans for that product then you could imagine another level where you've got a different set of people competing to put together strategic plans for each of the different sets each different set of products into a coherent plan for a whole business unit and then at the level above that you can have people competing to put together plans for the different business units into a plan for the company as a whole so that's what we call a contest web it's a web of contests at each level competing that's even could put together the things from the level below in the most interesting one so that i think is already an interesting way you could let lots more people be involved in creating ideas and then we need to decide which of those ideas are most promising we already talked about how you could do that hierarchically it could be that democratically another interesting possibility is to use markets to make those decisions for instance i think we talked a little bit already about prediction markets and how you can have people buying and selling predictions of different possible outcomes you could imagine something like that being used to help evaluate these different strategic plans people could be buying and selling predictions of if we use this product in this way what's the likely sales and profit for this unit in this product in different years you could have all kinds of people participating in these prediction markets so that's a way of bringing lots of people from throughout the company or perhaps from other companies even to help predict what would happen if you did different strategic plans so that's the decide as well as the create part how about sensing in order to come up with good plans in order to evaluate how promising they are you certainly need to sense the world that would affect those things and there are lots of ways as we know now of using big data as a way of doing that amazon for instance uses vast amounts of data from their customers and their suppliers and so forth to figure out all kinds of things like if you sell this combination of features for a particular lawnmower at this price this is the response you get but if you lower the price it does this and if you add this feature it does that so all kinds of things you can imagine sensing by computers primarily but of course humans are asking the questions and analyzing the results to help make the plans better you also can imagine systems helping people remember things better so for instance if you're coming up with strategic plans you all know as well as anyone that there are some kind of generic strategies that are often good ideas to consider some companies for instance compete on the basis of low cost others might predict but might compete on the basis of high quality so you can imagine a system that would help suggest to humans different generic strategies they could consider if they haven't already considered them and then you so that's more the remembering and then the final thing is to learn how could you learn to build better strategic plans this way there i think a really interesting possibility is what i call a cyber human learning loop so you could imagine for instance suppose you're trying to evaluate different parts of these strategic plans you could imagine having humans look at the different plans and saying yeah this is a good idea that's a bad idea these two are good ideas etc and you can imagine at the same time the humans are doing that you've got computers watching the input they received the decision they made and the computers using machine learning could be trying to determine the patterns that were that the people were using to make those decisions they wouldn't be able to understand all those patterns in general but at least some of them and more and more over time the computers might get pretty good at predicting what a human is going to do if they see one of these things and so the computer could start suggesting to the humans i think this is a case where you're going to say x if you agree you just click it and you don't even have to think about it much more if if not you change it and say whatever it's right but over time the computer would get better and better at guessing more and more of what the human would have done and eventually it might not even have to ask the human it could just do it automatically if the human always agrees with what the computer does in those cases so that's an example of how you could use combinations of people and computers to do all these different kind of cognitive processes involved in strategic planning and i think if you if you think about it what we've just described is kind of like a human computer strategy machine it kind of keeps generating strategies and you could imagine that it could do this so quickly and so effectively that it wouldn't do just one strategic plan a year it could do several strategic plans every day if it needed to so whenever any kind of little thing changes in the environment some new parts of the plan could be readjusted almost immediately and you could imagine that a company that could do this kind of planning could run circles around its competitors you know tom i just i got a riff on that for a moment because i think what you're saying sounds so radical uh that like people's heads may explode a little bit so let me let me just share a little bit of anecdotal personal experience there to underline like this is possible and and and it's kind of becoming an imperative as as you suggest there at the end you know and let me just back up a step because you know we're talking about superminds and i think and as mckayla kind of said too when it comes to strategy we we think the supermind is the ceo right and and if you say who's accountable for strategy or who's response like that person and and you're taught you know you're talking about procter gamble i i don't i don't want to really pick on them because they're they're a very smart a company and a very capable company but but let me let me share just to this little thing you know a.g lafley i think was twice a ceo chairman of procter gamble a very smart guy met him a super nice guy but he kind of expressed this thinking you know when when he said this this is an interview he said the ceo can see opportunities that others don't see and make the the judgments and tough calls are on it others are unable to make and you're like maybe maybe that's true but this idea that you know that that there's some small group of people at the top who have the the experience uh the cognitive capacity uh the the vision the creativity to kind of plot the future for an organization you're you're being very diplomatic but like that just like i don't think that works anymore and and here's my my little bit of shared ex my my my my own experience that my first uh kind of attempt with kind of open strategical average strategy was in 1993 with with nokia and uh they they they had asked me to come help them think about how do they beat motorola so we ended up we ended up involving a couple of thousand people at nokia in the strategy process we train them how to think about industry dogma how to get it unarticulated customer needs and then we sent them out to generate you know a whole bunch of new strategic options and out of that came a very interesting game changing strategy that generated a lot of wealth but unfortunately like 10 years later everybody was so happy and successful nobody wanted to bother to go back and like ask the organization again uh you know where should we go next so they ended up you know getting supplanted by apple but the the things i took away from that really really briefly were were this i mean first of all if you really want to create a groundbreaking strategy you got to create a lot of options right you need you need the the quality of any strategy depends on how many how many alternatives you generated in the first place and if it's a small group of people you just don't have very rich pickings i think this the second thing that that that hit me was that um you know as you're generating these ideas you really can't expect people at the top who have all their emotional equity invested in the business model they are not the best place to evaluate these options as you were saying you know it's more like a market and you want a lot of people saying that seems exciting or that seems kind of dumb but but when you have kind of just a small number of people are kind of judging jury on on on new ideas that's not going to go in a good place the third thing that struck me was that often this this collective intelligence you're talking about what's really amazing about that is not kind of individual ideas but it's the patterns and you start to see it in that in that case at nokia you start to see like a whole bunch of people say this thing can be more than just a phone you know it can be used for for payments it can be a camera it can be used for texting and so on and and and it's it's it's the strength of those patterns when you go like wow we have a lot of people who are seeing this and and then and the last thing uh that i took away from that is when you make that a broadly participative process where everybody sees like how we got to that strategic answer there's great enthusiasm for it at the end there's there's a lot of confidence in it and so you're radically shrinking this you know this time from from formulation to implementation so i don't know if those things you know you found in your own experience but i just want to say what you just said what you just laid out like that is i think the future of strategy and uh and i think it is a potentially huge source of competitive advantages to mine that collective intelligence to look for the patterns and uh you know and and doing it like top down we just see again and again those strategies are too orthodox you know they they they you know they're too bound by old thinking so it's i think you're pointing us i believe 100 in the right direction well it's nice to hear i guess i do think it's the future of strategy too uh and i think that um uh i think that the most companies in order to do this well will have to use a bunch of infrastructure i don't think this would be something that most companies can afford to build for themselves i think there'll be a bunch of strategic planning infrastructure it makes all this possible across companies i think that it's also an example of how real things can be done really differently i liked your your picture of aj lafley who actually said a lot of things i quoted in setting up the png context in my book i think he's right that sometimes the senior people can see things that others can't but what he leaves out and what i think is extremely important is that the opposite is true too sometimes people at the bottom of the organization or in all different parts of the organization can see things the senior executives can't see that leads to a segway here and then let's spend some time on this um because you know you're saying okay we may need this new kind of technology infrastructure to do this that may be the case i mean i'm thinking we i mean we've done these open strategy things like before the internet and and and and i think technology now does make it possible you know you can put up a mooc you can put up an idea market there are a lot of tools if you're serious about this i think that could help you do it but but here's what i would ask you know this idea of open strategy you're just talking about it and you know there's other folks uh like like hank chessborough at at berkeley who have ideas in this realm and i'll show you something and and this is this is a little slide that that i put together in 1997. so that's quite a long time ago this was after and we'd done a couple of these open uh strategy projects and it was clear that technology by bringing people together making all the thinking transparent you know involving lots of people allowing you to upload video and make the conversation kind of richer and more emotional experiential uh you know just shrinking the time i mean it was clear that a lot of the things that you've talked about here that this was possible so i guess my segue is this tom like why aren't organizations embracing this this is so logical many of the tools are already there and you know and you've been writing about this for a while your internal markets pieces you know i when did you write that a couple of decades ago i guess what what is holding organizations back from embracing the power of collective intelligence in helping them like design their future i think the short answer is outdated mindsets i have a friend at the mit media lab a faculty member named mitch resnick who's talked for many years about what he calls the centralized mindset so most of us grew up in a world where hierarchies really were the best way of doing most things and we just think of that naturally if you want to solve a problem you need to put someone in charge if something went wrong you need to figure out who to blame and who's going to fix it those things work well in some many situations in the past but not all situations and i think fewer and fewer all the time because the technology makes it possible to coordinate effectively in much more decentralized ways that weren't possible before so i think the technology makes it possible to do things long before human norms and human habits and human mindsets and human imagination catch up with it take a take a simple example of the automobile or in fact think of think of the changes that occurred as the automobile became more widespread and cheaper and better the first order change was that we substituted automobiles for other kinds of transportation like horses or walking that's not too hard to imagine once you see it you can kind of do it but it still takes a while for you to sell your horse and get over your fear of these newfangled things that make noise and stuff that's the first order change a second order change by the way i'm giving you this from a scientific american article i wrote in about 1991 i believe uh the second second article second uh order of change is when something gets cheaper and better like transportation with automobiles we do a lot more of it so instead of going to town once a week maybe you can go to town every day and pick up milk if you forgot to buy it when you were there two days ago so you just do more and more transportation when it gets cheaper and then the third order effect with transportation is you develop new transportation intensive structures like suburbs and shopping malls those wouldn't have been possible without the cheap communication of cars but we wouldn't have even thought to do them until we had gone through the first two stages we had to kind of get used to it before our imagination and the economics would even make it possible to come up with and then implement those ideas i think the same i think the same things are happening with communication and organization as communication gets cheaper and cheaper we go through these three orders of effects more of it first we substitute the old way for the new way then we do more and more of the communication and then we develop new communication and coordination intensive structures that wouldn't even have been imaginable much less feasible without that cheap communication ability so so you're you're giving us a um positive picture about the future that this is kind of inevitable you were just need to let the system play itself out but you know we are you know some in a bit in a way a little impatient like because we'd like to create organizations that are more capable to meet the needs of the 21st century and so you know i'd love to get your thoughts on like how how might we accelerate this this adoption and how about we deal with the issue of power right because it seems to me that and it's related to mindset but but it may be deeper in the sense that you know one reason why people may not want to bid out a question about how how whether we should do this merger or acquisition or whether we should launch this project uh to product into a prediction market is that if if the executive wants to do that does it and it fails and it confirms what the collective intelligence of the firm said that person will look foolish and may lose their job or they may not be able to justify their big compensation package if they're like bidding out the question of what the company should do to a large group of people right uh and you know what what's their value added if they're not making the big big decisions and why should they deserve you know the 10 million dollar pay package they have and so so how much of this is is is is about that and overcoming uh the way power is is is distributed in companies today yeah let me let me just let me just add one thing to that you know if you look at the growth of social media these new collaborative technologies it it it wasn't the the you know the gatekeepers of the old media who said hey let's create youtube and let everybody post their content or twitter right i mean that took kind of a a revolution and they were winners and losers so just to building on mckinney's point about power yeah so now you're bringing in the fifth kind of supermind which i called ecosystems where it's whoever has the most power gets what they want that doesn't explain everything in the world but it does explain a lot of important things including the examples you're just bringing up if you're in a big hierarchy and some people have a whole lot more power than others and they don't want to lose the benefits they get from that power they can often delay by quite a long time changes that might have made sense economically long ago sometimes by the way it's not even just that it's just changing norms i think we saw a great example of that just in the last year with covid and things that were possible in march of 2020 but no one remotely imagined that they were going to happen in may of 2020 about everybody working remotely it was possible technically them only very recently by the way but it took in that case a huge external shock from the environment to accelerate a change much faster than would ordinarily have happened if everybody had had to kind of agree and change the norms along the way so i think people with power absent huge external shocks like that really can delay these things and to the degree that things can be done better if power is distributed much more widely that gets delayed when people who have power don't want to give it up but i think in the longer term eventually other things like the economic desirability and the human desirability of doing things in a better way eventually wins how can you accelerate that there's probably a lot of specific answers uh in general you know you need to come up with the new ideas and try them out that's basically entrepreneurial activity you could say that elon musk accelerated the adoption of electric cars not by writing articles about how it was a good idea but by actually proving that you could do it and making the other companies realize they had to compete or they'd be left behind so that's one way of accelerating it there's certainly also a lot to be said for changing mindsets and changing cultures so there is value to be kind of had by writing about this and popularizing these ideas and all those things so i don't think there's any single answer i guess one thing i've said ever since i talked about the future of work is that the the most important new innovations are probably in this domain are probably not going to come first in the big powerful successful old companies they're probably going to come first in the new scrappy weird companies and it's only when they turn out to work really well that the other more traditional companies will adopt those ideas does that make sense yeah it totally it does and you know maybe you know we in in our book we've we have a few examples of companies that you use the power of markets you know the allocational agility or the collective intelligence in piecemeal ways we have an example of intel using prediction markets to forecast sales of particular products and we have an example of ibm you know they have a they have a long history of this with innovation jams but more recently they did the this initiative called cognitive build which is about you know uh getting from thousands of employees ideas about you know the next billion dollar business for the company so but you're right i mean a lot of these companies do it and they may not stick with it you know they move on to the next thing and it doesn't get systematized the the company that we know well that has probably the most evolved model uh where you're leveraging markets and and and and the external environment to a full extent is higher um you know where where literally the whole company is is supposed to be sensing what's happening in the markets they're dividing into these small enterprises that contract with each other uh that you know seek capital from outside as much as inside and so on but now and hopefully since the company is doing well and they become a large player in appliances you know others will will start start to learn but but as you say you know they will need to uh draw some pretty hard lessons about uh you know the executive team will about their role and let me just maybe ask you one more question on that uh not not to paint this like you know i don't want to be the uh the the person that only has bad news or paints a uh a gloomy picture but one could argue that advances in technology whether it's ai or big data may actually have a countervailing effect uh to what you're saying that is you know they may actually give more information to people at the top who with their own judgment or maybe you know aided by algorithms you know get get to run or seek to run the company by kind of remote controlling their on their ipad and and so like do you think that is a uh well-founded fear or or or not well i think cheap communication can allow both more centralized control for the reason you said and more decentralized decentralized control for the reasons we were talking about earlier so both are possible uh in my book the future of work i talked about uh the sort of simple conditions needed for one to dominate over the other and if you have basically if you have some benefits of decentralized decision making that are important like you get more creativity or more motivation or whatever if those things are important then they will dominate the ability of the centralized decision maker to control things they can still try to do that but it won't work as well you get benefits from the decentralization so that's why i think that while it won't happen everywhere it's likely to happen in more and more parts of our economy yeah you know tom i want to go back to a couple things you've talked about you know one you know you said you know you talked about the old mindsets and the centralizing mindset and i just want to underline like i think that is like a huge part of of what's been holding us back and and and and this will give us a segue to another question we have for you but again let me let me share a little example that goes way back in history so back in the in the 17th century when uh muskets came into uh muskets and fusiliers came into military warfare they basically just substituted what had been uh archers for for musketeers and so you you still had all these pikemen in the middle with the long pikes to impale the enemy and then on their flanks you have these musketeers and you ask like oh why now we have the musket why are we still using pikemen at all and and why do you have musketeers like eight or nine ranks deep that doesn't seem to make sense uh you know archers fire over the heads of but like musketeers not so much and the guys who looked at the history of this it's a wonderful book on on revolutions and military affairs it's called but they but they looked at this and it literally takes more than a hundred years for them to kind of change the way they organize uh uh you know combat units to reflect this new technology and and and and and the guys who did this research you know what they were trying to answer like why did it take so long and and the conclusion they came to us well you had to wait for a couple of generations of generals to die off right and then finally now we can use this and and what you said ring so true you know the the your analogy about the automobile because what it seems to us is if you look at the way collaborative technologies are being used now and i kind of sometimes derisively call these like project aware but you know it's the slack and it's the microsoft teams and so on it seems like we said okay we can use these new collaborative tools to make white collar work more efficient like you know the the 21st century version of microsoft office so we can allow teams to share documents set schedules coordinated and so on but the real questions that you're raising is well how do we do this to change the way we we we make strategy how do we do this to change the way we allocate resources or mckayla's example about higher right how do we use markets for to to for very dynamic interfering coordination that allows us to reconfigure rather than like doing that through a hierarchy and it seems to me you know that that when you look back to history our organizational innovation has often lagged the technology innovation by a long time is that your experience and you know maybe to circle back like anything else that can be done to accelerate that i think it's always going to take some time for humans to adapt to the new possibilities their technology enables we can accelerate that by things we've already talked about entrepreneurial activity cultural change etc but i think it's always going to take some time and in some sense perhaps we shouldn't be at all surprised that it's taking us decades to incorporate into our new organizational thinking the capabilities that technologies have made possible it would be what would be really amazing is that if it happened overnight or in a month or in a year it's certainly going to take years and in many cases decades i think for the ramifications of these technologies and the possibilities of these technologies to really be realized in the ways we design our organizations all right tom thanks thanks for inspiring us and and it may take time but i think you've also said there is there is a payoff to being in front on some of these things if you do it in the right way so so thanks for sharing that you know tom's book the future of work is still at the bleeding edge you want to check that out superminds as well follow tom online what he's writing super helpful tom thanks for being part of the conversation thank you great conversation thanks a lot you
