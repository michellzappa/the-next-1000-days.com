we are about to have ai reinvent Global education and Healthcare this is the biggest shift in human history we are at a perfect store perfect store your mindset our brains are neural Nets they're being shaped constantly by everything we watch everything we read the conversations we have our communities and so forth in the age of the rise of the Machines the only skill that will remain is human connection we need to bring that back to our children we need to teach them resilience it's training them to respond to anything that happens you may tell yourself I'm about to lose my job because of AI is this true yes it is live because you know what you have certainty that today is not a perfect storm yet think about this minute how can I Savor this minute fully I'm going to transition the conversation uh staying on kids um Kristen and I have two 12-year-old boys and they're uh you know a joy and after this podcast is over I'll be going and hugging them and spending time with them for sure extra um and one of the things that we're thinking about because they're in sixth grade and heading towards High School in a world that is very different uh than the world you and I grew up in and I am clear that uh today's schooling system set aside College but junior high school high school is not preparing our kids for what's coming right our school system is based on the industrial era everyone's you know prepared for the test everybody is going from Station to Station learning things like one of our boys jet just had to memorize all 50 state capitals now it's great to practice your memorization but really how and when are you going to ever have that be useful yeah you know especially when Google is uh is still a dominant Force so the question I have and for those who are listeners are parents is what should our kids be learning uh you know this is coming back smack into the conversation around uh the rise of AI um and what do we need to teach our kids to prepare them for this decade ahead and I have a list that I've come up with and then I went and asked asked you know chat GPT the same question and uh similar but slightly different list but I'd like to ask you in a world let's call it you know we're 2023 uh we're going to about to see AI become um what's your well I'll ask you this you know Ray CW who we both know well has predicted human level AI by 2029 there are others who are predicting it far before then about by the way right there are those that are looking at you know 2025 and between 2025 and 29 so what should our kids be learning in a world of human level AI by the way embedded in everything where everything is smart all the time what are the skills amazing question and and probably the most difficult question to ask now not for just I mean not just for our kids but for everyone I mean if you're a graphics designer today or if you're a programmer the episode with withad withad mushak was amazing Peter it was an amazing conversation people who haven't listened to it should go back and listen uh you know the the world is fundamentally changing in ways that we we could not understand I think I will say there are four things that that need to be uh educated okay uh none of them have anything to do with what we our school systems are teaching the the first and very straightforward one is jump in into AI okay you have to learn this this is the biggest shift in human history uh this is the biggest you know change in the tools that we uh that we use to navigate the world right if if I told you that we now have robotic arms that are going to be building cars you shouldn't spend any time in learning how to use a hammer to shape matter okay uh so learn how the robotic arm works the new robotic arm is AI so jump in AI understand every part of it you don't need a school to do that you know because I speak about AI quite a bit a lot of people ask me so which book do you recommend I I read or which course should I take and I go like go ask Chad GPT that right why are you asking me and seriously right and I think the idea is like every other tool no very few people actually went to courses on Excel or you know email okay you know yeah you play around and you learn so so so this is number one number two is I would say that in the age of the rise of the Machines the only skill that will remain is human connection MH the only skill in my personal view that will uh be valuable when the machines outsmart Us in everything by the way it doesn't matter I I I always want to bring this back I'm sorry I'm going to back go back to number two in a second but the doesn't matter if AGI comes out and we have the singularity as per raise uh uh definition 2029 I actually definitely believe AI will be earlier than 2029 uh but it doesn't matter what matters is if you're a graphics designer and stability AI you know produced St stable diffusion you're screwed it's over okay we don't need AGI for your life to be disrupted heavily we don't need a to to to to to you know to replace lawyers we don't need a AGI to you know to augment doctors and so on and so forth this is in the making it's happening very very fast so you know don't don't wait for that imaginary moment or that future moment to say ah now we're in we're approaching those situations already now so when all of that happens and all of those skills are replaced with humans I would say that the most valuable skill is human connection so take my situation I am an author okay and a speaker and in a way a teacher if you want okay very much um and and a podcaster right so as an author I don't think I should write books anymore right I I I uh I take too long to write them the industry is very slow to publish them and the supply demand equation of books is going to be disrupted so badly because books now can be written in 50 minutes okay that there will be so much Supply on the market that by definition the dilution will affect the value of any any book and in all honesty I don't assume I'm smarter than Chad GPT I may be a little more genuine than than Chad GPT I may be a little more original than chat GPT some yeah and some of my writing but that Advantage is not going to last for the next two to three years so but if I know a concept and I have a chance to talk to you as human Peter I don't think the machines would reach that within the next four to five years right so human connection even if the machines reach that in four to five years is what we will crave as humans right there will be sex robots but I can guarantee you you'll still need a hug yes right there will there will be you know um articles written by there might there are tons of Articles written by AI today there is a ton of code written by AI today but there is always going to be that need for a human to consult a human to you know a circle of support if you want so that's skill number two skill number two is learn how to connect to humans at a deeper level it's a skill that has been uh declining since the uh rise of social media okay in other words are are the skills that humans have to focus on connection and deliver and maximize connection but we also spoke in our last podcast mode that um AI will begin to emulate human connection correct and your time frame for that was within the next 10 years oh if not shorter yeah I mean in in all in all honesty I I think it will become very confusing within the next three if you remember the movie her I remember it well yeah her her her basically an AI simulates uh friend uh and then she becomes quite you know he becomes very occupied with loving her as an AI okay it's an interesting it's a lovely uh story if you think it's one of the most most uh positive and perhaps realistic versions of AI that I've seen out there if you haven't seen her please go do it it's it's a beautiful construct and at the end of the movie no I won't spoil it anyway uh yeah but but but but the but the whole concept of us connecting to machines I don't see anything wrong with that by the way I I I love the idea of being able to connect to a body that can help me learn things and so on it's wonderful you know I think this will shift deeply into erotic experiences and emotional experiences and romantic experiences where so many people are lonely and they'll use this to replace an annoying girlfriend or an annoying boy boyfriend or whatever sadly right but I I still believe there will be a space for human connection okay there will be a space where genuine human connection the kind that you feel when you meet an old friend is still going to be very valuable and I and I as I said I think this is a skill that's been eroding over the last 105 years because of social media we need to bring that back to our children so that's number two on your list yeah that was number two on your list number three is is sad when I say it but we need to teach them resilience okay uh and resilience not just because of AI as a matter of fact as I said I don't know if we said that last time but I say it repeatedly we are at a perfect store perfect store I mean uh if you just think about the world finances and economics there's never been a better match in history to the times of the Great Depression than today okay so it it seems if you know anything about economics that there is a very deep economic crisis ahead of okay there is a geopolitical layer on top of the economic crisis that might accentuate it okay uh there is a climate crisis that we're so far only seeing the tip of the iceberg of you know 3 million people being displaced in Pakistan last year the Australian fires and so on and so forth when when in reality you you know anyone with a reasonable ability to look at Trends will tell you we we may get more of these okay uh and so so resilience seems to me to be a very useful skill and resilience is not training them uh what to do when certain things happen it's training them to respond to anything that happens the happiness equation is the core of that when you think about I'll just take a couple of minutes to to digress a little bit huh when you think that happiness is events minus expectations okay then unhappiness is or any negative emotion is when an event misses your expectations okay and when an event misses your expectations your brain sounds the alarm okay oh he said this she you know he doesn't love me anymore whatever something's going wrong right yeah something's going wrong now we may think of that feeling as an annoying feeling it is your brain is sounding the alarm because it is an alarm unhappiness and all of its derivatives is a survival mechanism okay it's your brain telling you something in the surrounding environment does not match my world viiew of an Optimum scenario for my survival and thriving okay and so what happens is your brain is simply saying we need to do something about this now resilience in my view is to actually do something about it right resilience in my view is to take it and go through three questions I call them the happiness flowchart okay question number one is is what is what my brain telling me true yes okay uh because 90% of the time it isn't your brain is telling you what it thinks is true but it isn't always the truth you may have an argument with your son and then you will say oh my son doesn't love me anymore that's that's these are two different events the event that your brain is telling you is influenced by your fears and your conditioning and so on and so forth right while the actual event is I had an argument with my son right so the first question is is it true okay the second question if it's if it's not true by the way drop it don't be unhappy about anything that doesn't make me that is is not even true right if it is true the second question is what can I do to fix it okay what can I do to fix it you know in in today's world you may tell yourself I'm about to lose my job because of AI H is this true yes it is is okay if it is what can I do to fix that situation I can upskill and find another job okay I can downscale and and move to a Dominican Republic and live for a fraction of what I'm I'm spending in the US right whatever there if there is something you can do to fix that situation this is where resilience comes in yes right that's that's exactly what it is now the third is the Judi Master Level of Happiness Judi Master level of happiness is quite interesting it basically there are things that you can that you are faced with that that you cannot do anything to fix right so if if the answer to the question what can I do to fix it is nothing like there is an economic crisis coming okay if if you know can what can I do to fix that there's nothing within your own power as an individual to stop an economic crisis okay so the following question which I think is the die Master Level of Happiness the die Master Level of resilience is can I accept it and do something to make my life better despite its presence okay can I can I simply tell myself this is it I can't fix an economic crisis coming but I can take care of my kids and my loved ones and change my spending habits and sell my car and do this and that right it doesn't make my life amazing but it makes it better within the current circumstances that I accepted okay so that to me is resilience and happiness combined those three questions and I think we need to teach our kids by example to show that level of resilience when life doesn't go their way they need to go is it true can I do something to fix it can I accept it and make my life better despite its presence hey everybody this is Peter a quick break from the episode you I'm a firm believer that science and technology and how entrepreneurs can change the world is the only real news out there worth consuming I don't watch the crisis News Network I call CNN or Fox and hear every devastating piece of news on the planet I spend my time training my neuronet the way I see the World by looking at the incredible breakthroughs in science and technology how entrepreneurs are solving the world's Grand challenges what the breakthroughs are in longevity how exponential Technologies are Transforming Our World so twice a week I put out a Blog one blog is looking at the future of longevity age reversal biotech increasing your health span the other blog looks at EXP iial Technologies AI 3D printing synthetic biology AR VR blockchain these Technologies are transforming what you as an entrepreneur can do if this is the kind of use you want to learn about and shape your neural Nets with go to D andis.com back/ blog and learn more now back to the episode this comes back to something I speak about a lot and I'm passionate about which is mindsets right your mindset our brains are neural Nets they're being shaped constantly by everything we watch everything we we read the conversations we have our communities and so forth and you can have an abundance mindset uh or a scarcity mindset you can have an optimism mindset or a fear mindset and just to hit on this a little bit you know you said we're in a perfect storm coming of these problems but the flip side of that as well is and we have incredible tools more than ever before incredible opportunities that's what rise of it as well we are about to have ai reinvent Global education and Healthcare right we're going to enable so much that we could not the challenges of humanity to be addressed and solved so despite the perfect storm on the negative side uh we do have the ability for people to uplift Humanity right we are going to see uh you know generative Ai and AGI help us with curing cancer and and lowcost Fusion Energy and all of these things and it's the it's the balance it's the potential um your fourth item my fourth item is going to be difficult to explain but I will try as much as I can our brain's bias at looking at difficult situations and perfect storms is biased to make it look like this is more uncertain than any other moment in your life so so you look at the economy changing and AI rising and climate change and the geopolitical situation and you say this is very uncertain okay something is likely going to go wrong okay the truth is someone like me who loses his child all of a sudden to preventable medical error uh at a moment of his prime realizes that this actually is the case of Life all the time no guarant that we're always in a perfect store right that we are always i i as I as I said earlier I have no guarantee whatsoever that I will ever see you again Peter MH okay I might leave the world within two minutes from now I have and by the way it happens all the time it happens all the time that the world surprises us a tidal wave or a or a or an erupted uh uh volcano or someone that you loved so much that you hugged and played tennis with you know leaves our world an hour later or whatever okay and that's the reality of the video game the reality of the video game is there is only now any real video gamer I'm a very serious video gamer by the way for those of you listening the one that killed you yesterday is me okay uh as simple as that right but but but I but but but every every real video game I by the I'm not addicted at all I play 45 minutes a day four times a week but I'm Olympic champion level okay and I will tell you real Gamers real Gamers understand that the game has no State a minute later okay when a minute later is rendered on the screen I will deal with it and because I'm a very good gamer I know I'll be able to deal with any challenge that comes a minute later right my challenge is this minute and my joy is this minute being present now yeah right here right now if if if life is in a perfect storm I tell people live live because you know what you have certainty that today is not a perfect storm yet you have certainty that your kids are wonderful and there in your arms today you have certainty that you're going to have dinner tonight you have certainty that your battery on your phone is going to last another five minutes to hopefully finish our conversation okay when when you have those certainties don't think about what's going to happen when the battery runs out think about this minute how can I Savor this minute fully okay and and I and I speak sometimes about again you don't have to be spiritual to think of those things but I I studied a ton of spiritual techniques okay a ton of spiritual teachings almost everything I could get my hands on from the cabala to Islam to sofism to Hinduism to Buddhism anything I could find my hands on and I put my hands on and I'll tell you openly every one of them is beautifully full of gold nuggets and beautifully full of crap okay and and it's quite interesting how some people will say oh here is a pit P piece of crap I'm going to drop the whole book while in reality I I go like here is a piece of gold I'm going to look for another one okay the most beautiful of all of them is what Sufi Sufism is a sect of Islam originally but it's now part of a lot of spiritual you know beliefs where basically they say that the way to live fully is to die before you die okay and to die before you die is a very very interesting definition it basically assumes that living is a process of associating with the physical associating with your car with your ego with your T-shirt with your uh you know whatever and that death is the moment of disconnection of every with everything physical okay and to die before you die is to be alive fully fully engaged in the game but not give a about losing any of it MH okay and that's a very again a video Gamers mentality is to say I'm going to do this bit I'm going to do it the best that I can play full out I'm fully out there right and I'm going to enjoy it fully but I'm not attached to the result because the result is bigger than me and what I think people need to do in the world we live in today is to learn to live because when we spoke last time in in the AI episode I told you openly it is game over for our way of life the way we live today 5 years from now is going to be non-existent how will it change Better or Worse doesn't it's not the topic but it's not going to be like it is right now so when we are here right now and you love this way of life enjoy the hell out of it live it fully connect to it fully play the game and enjoy the fun and prepare yourself by detaching from things that might be taken away from you okay prepare for yourself to get other things that might be given to you and that kind of flow in life I know sounds very philosophical in a in a world where we're talking economics and politics and so on but I can tell you that real Gamers when they die you know the reason why we Gamers play really well is because we have multiple life in the game right so I'm not saying this from a physical from a spiritual point of view but I'm saying when you don't care if you're killed in the game you play full out right okay and and I think that's the the idea the idea is yes the future might hold some challenges learn to live and if you learn to live if you learn to flow if you learn to savor those Beautiful Moments we have right now okay then what happens tomorrow doesn't really matter when tomorrow comes if you're prepared through through the the three points I said uh earlier if you pre if you're prepared hopefully you'll over you'll be able to overcome that too you know it's interesting because none of those things are what we teach in school today to bring it back to the original question I'm going to share with you I'm going to share with you my list um that I wrote down and then maybe chat gpt's list um because I think about this I think about you know do do we need to reinvent it um because I I'm clear that the momentum that our school systems have uh is not going to change um until it's forced to change uh so what I put on my list is helping our kids first off find their purpose and passion um and there's a distinction between purpose and passion but it is something that you know I found my purpose and passion early on from Apollo and Star Trek right it was opening up space it lit my heart on fire everything I've ever done is a result of that passion that dream you know to learn on my own uh but it can be anything you can make career out of anything these days but what is it that lights you on fire and makes you happy and gives you Joy the second thing I put down was um a combination of debate leadership and asking great questions uh you know I when I drop my kids off at school every day I say ask great questions right you know today it's about asking you know prompting uh chat GPT properly but it's it's the questions we ask um you know I give this advice to CEOs at the same time ask great questions and it's the questions that you've never allowed yourself to ask uh as a as a child or as a leader um but leadership and I want to come back to leadership in a little bit uh helping our kids understand what leadership is and how to lead how to have a vision how to connect with individuals um curiosity right I think that's innate in children in the youngest of children but we lose it over time and that goes back to asking great questions and so maintaining it creating a a curiosity practice um solution oriented thinking um you know where the notion is if there's a problem um rather than focusing on the problem really do a judo mind trick or Jedi mind trick to focus on the solution because there are Solutions um critical thinking first principal thinking uh exponential thinking and then philosophy um which is going to be more valuable than ever before I believe that yeah when hear chat GPT list philosophy you know in in in the sense of dealing with the uncertain really you know being able to manage knowledge in the ambiguity of not really knowing uh I asked chat GPT and I said okay what are the skills that our kids need to be taught in high school to prepare them for a world of advanced AI um it said adaptability um continuous learning critical thinking emotional intelligence ethical awareness and resilience h i i i like the adaptability bit very much actually well it's going to say you know adapt to AI listen to your master listen to your master uh but this is a conversation I'm going to be having for a while which is what are the skills that are going to prepare our kids um because they're going to spend a huge amount of time and then be thrust into living on their own and it's this decade that things are changing dramatically yeah the next three years yeah yeah next three years you keep on saying next three years versus decade and you're right it is the speed of change is uh is there are there are there are tiny little triggers that are Beyond repair okay so if if Imad mustak in your uh you know he he boldly says no developers in five years okay so that's if you're the most conservative human on the planet that assumes a 20% job loss in the development SC landscape uh every year imagine if 20% of all the developers you know in California have lost their job every year from now on that's a very significant redesign of the fabric of society okay and and and I think the reality is it's around the [Music] Cor
