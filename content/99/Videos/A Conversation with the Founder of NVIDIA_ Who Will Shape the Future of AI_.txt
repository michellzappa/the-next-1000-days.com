it's my pleasure and privilege to be sitting in front of all of you here today to moderate a Pioneer not just in the technology space but in the artificial space as well artificial intelligence space Jensen who um is leading probably the company that's at the center of the eye of the storm when it comes to artificial intelligence the hype the possibilities and what this technology with mean Jens it's a pleasure being with you on stage here thank you it's great to be here when I'm amazing conference I um just want to say that we really appreciate you taking the time especially since you have GTC in 6 weeks in six weeks I'm going to tell everybody about a whole bunch of new things we've been working on the next generation of AI every single year they just push the envelope when it comes to artificial intelligence and GTC so um we're hoping to get a few Snippets out of this okay so I'd like to start with a um question that was going on in my mind how many gpus can we buy for 7 trillion well apparently all the gpus I I I think this is one thing I'm I'm waiting to ask Sam about because it's it's a really big number talk about ambition we have a lot of ambition here in the UA we don't lack ambition but is there a view that you can give the government leaders today with regards to compute capabilities and artificial intelligence how can they plan well where do you think the deployment is going to make sense and what advice you have uh well first of all these are amazing times these are amazing times because we're at the beginning of a new Industrial Revolution production of energy through Steam production of electricity it and information revolution with PC and internet then now artificial intelligence uh we are experiencing two simultaneous uh Transitions and this has never happened before the first transition is the end of general purpose Computing and the beginning of accelerated Computing it's like specialized Computing using CPUs for computation as the foundation of everything we do is no longer possible and the reason for that is because it's been 60 years we invented central processing units in 1964 the announcement of the IBM Sy uh system 360 we've been writing that wave for literally UH 60 years now and this is now the beginning of accelerated Computing if you want sustainable Computing energy efficient Computing high performance Computing cost effect cost Effective computing you can no longer do it with general purpose Computing you need specialized domain specific acceleration and that's what driving at the foundation our growth accelerated Computing it's the most sustainable way of doing uh Computing going forward it's the most energy efficient um it is so energy efficient it's so coste effective it's so performance so performant that it enabled a new type of application called AI the question is what's the cart and and the horse you know first is accelerated Computing and enabled a new uh new application there's a whole bunch of applications that are accelerated today and so now we're in the beginning of this new uh New Era uh and what's going to happen is there's a about a trillion dollar worth of installed base of data centers around the world and over the course of the next four or five years we'll have $2 trillion do worth of data centers um that will be uh uh powering software around the world and all of it is going to be accelerated and and this architecture for Accelerated Computing is ideal for this next generation of software called generative Ai and so that's really at the core of what is happening uh while we're repl placing the install base of general purpose Computing remember that the performance of the architecture is going to be improving at the same time so you can't assume just that you will buy more computers you have to also assume that the computers are going to become faster and therefore the total amount that you need is not going to be as much otherwise the mathematics if you just assume you know that that computers never get any faster you might come to the con conclusion we need 14 different planets and three different galaxies and you know four four more Suns and um to to fuel all this but but obviously uh computer architecture continues to advance in the last 10 years one of the greatest contributions and I really appreciate you mentioning that um the rate of innovation one of the greatest contributions we made was advancing Computing and advancing AI by 1 million times in the last 10 years and so whatever demand that you think is going to power the the world you have to consider the fact that it is also going to do it one million times larger faster you know more efficiently don't you think that creates a risk of having a world of halves and Have Nots since we need to constantly invest to ensure that we have The Cutting Edge and to ensure that we are able to create the applications that are going to reshape the world and governments as we know them do you think that there's going to be an issue of countries that can afford uh these gpus and countries that can't and if not because you know it' be surprising if you said the answer is no if not what are going to be the drivers of equity excellent question um first of all when something improves by a million times and the cost or the space or the energy that it consumed did not grow up by a million times in fact you've democratized the technology um researchers all over the world would tell you that Nvidia singlehandedly democratized high performance Computing we put it in the hands of every researcher it is the reason why uh AI researchers uh Jeff Hinton in University of Toronto Yan Lun I think Yan's going to be here uh University of uh New York um Andrew Ang uh in uh Stanford simultaneously discovered us they didn't discover us because of supercomputers they discovered us because of gaming gpus that they used for deep learning we put accelerated Computing or high performance Computing in the hands of every single researcher in the world and so when we accelerate the rate of innovation we're democratizing the technology the cost of building purchasing a supercomputer today is really negligible and the reason for that is because we're making it faster and faster and faster whatever performance you need costs a lot less today than used to it is absolutely true we have to democratize this technology and the reason the reason why is very clear there's an Awakening of every single country in probably the last six months that artificial intelligence is a technology you can't be mystified by you cannot be terrified by it you have to find a way to activate yourself to take advantage of it and the reason for that is because this is the beginning of a new Industrial Revolution this Industrial Revolution is about the production not of energy not of food but the production of intelligence and every country needs to own the production of their own intelligence which is the reason why there's this idea called Sovereign AI you own your own data nobody owns it your country owns the data your cult it it it codifies your culture your society's intelligence your common sense your history you own your own own data you therefore must take that data refine that data and own your own National Intelligence you can't cannot allow that to be done by other people and that is a real realization now that we've democratized the computation of AI the infrastructure of AI the rest of it is really up to you to take initiative activate your uh your uh industry uh build the infrastructure as fast as you can so that the researchers the companies your governments can take advantage of this infrastructure to go and create your own AI I I think we completely subscribe to that Vision um that's why the UAE is moving aggressively on creating large language models IM mobilizing compute and maybe work with other partners of this let's try to flip the Paradigm a little bit let's today assume that Jensen hang is the president of of a developing nation that has a relatively small GDP and you can focus on one AI application what would it be let's call it a hypothetical nation and say that you know you have so many problems that you need to deal with what is the first thing that you're going to approach if you're going to mobilize artificial intelligence in that scenario the first thing you have to do is you have to build infrastructure if you want to if you want to mobilize the production of food you have to build farms if you want to mobilize the production of energy you have to build AC generators if you want to if you want to operationalize information digital if you want to digitalize your economy you have to build the internet um if you want to automate the creation of artificial intelligence you have to build the infrastructure it is not that cost it's not that it's not that costly it is also not that hard um companies all around the world of course wants to mystify terrify glorify you know all of those uh those those ideas but the fact of the matter is they're computers you can buy them off the shelf uh you can install it uh every country needs already has the expertise to do this uh and you you have to you surely need to have the imperative To Go activate that um the first thing that I would do of course is I would codify the uh language the the data of your culture into your own large language model and you're doing that here uh core 42 um Saudi ramco uh uh uh uh uh s sad um really doing uh important work to uh codify the Arabic language and creating your own large language model um but simultaneously remember that AI is not just about language AI we're seeing several AI revolutions happening at the same time AI for language AI for biology learning the language of protein Mach and and chemicals uh AI for physical sciences learning the AI of climate materials energy Discovery AI of iot the language of keeping places safe computer vision and such um AI for iot AI for Robotics and autonomous systems manufacturing and such there's AI revolutions happening AI great breakthroughs happening in all of these different domains and if you build the infrastructure you will activate the researchers in every one of these domains without the internet how can you be digital without Farms how can you produce food without an AI infrastructure how can you activate all of the researchers that are in your region to go and create the AI models you touched upon um the issue of I would say authentic ignorance the fear mongering AI taking over the world and um I I think there is a requirement for us to clarify where the hype is real and where artificial intelligence really has the power to create a lot of disruption and to harm us and where AI is going to be good what do you think is the biggest issue when it comes to artificial intelligence right now because I think the the the problem of regulating AI is like trying to say we want to regulate a field of computer science or regulate electricity you don't regulate electricity as a invention or as a discovery you regulate a specific use case what is one use case that you think we need to regulate against and that government should mobilize towards e excellent question um first of all whatever new incredible technology is being created uh you go back to the earliest of times uh it is absolutely true we have to develop the technology safely we have to apply the technology safely and we have to help people use the technology safely and so uh whether it's um uh the plane that I came in uh cars uh Manufacturing Systems medicine all of these different Industries are heavily regulated today those regulations have to be extended augmented to consider artificial intelligence artificial intelligence will come to us through products and services it is the automation of intelligence and it will be augmented on top of all of these various Industries now it is the case that that there are some interests to scare people about this uh new technology to mystify this technology to encourage other people to not do anything about that technology and rely on them to do it and I think that that's a mistake we want to democratize this technology let's face it the single most important thing that has happened last year if you were to ask me the one single most important event last year and how it has activated AI researchers here in this region it's actually llama 2 it's an open- Source model or falcon or Falcon another excellent model very true uh M trell excellent model uh a I just I just saw another one uh a smog um there's so many open source models Innovations on safety alignment um uh uh Guard railing uh reinforcement learning so many different reasoning so many different innovations that are happening on top of transparencies explainability all of this technology that has to be built all were possible because of some of these open source languages and so I think that democratizing activating every region activating every country to join the AI Advance is probably one of the most important thing rather than ex convincing everybody it's too complicated it's too dangerous it's too my mystical and only two or three people in the world should be able to do that that I think is a huge mistake uh the the uh Focus I think that we have done in the UAE is to focus on open source systems because we do believe that anything that we develop here should be given as um a opportunity for others that can't develop it most of this is developed using gpus so graphic processing units that you guys um are are supplying the world what do you think the next era is going to depend on is it going to continuously be built on gpus is there something else as a breakthrough that we're going to see in the future you think actually uh you know that that in just about all of the large companies in the world uh there are internal developments uh at Google there's tpus at um AWS there's tranium at Microsoft there's Maya uh uh has um uh chips that they're building uh in China just about every single CSP has chips that they're building the reason why you mention inidia gpus is NVIDIA GPU is the only platform that's available to everybody on any platform that's actually the observation it's not that we're the only platform that's being used we're simply the only platform that's used that democratizes AI for everybody's platform we're in every single Cloud we're in every single data center were available in the cloud uh in your private data centers all the way out to the edge all the way out to autonomous systems Robotics and self-driving Cars one single architecture spans all of that that's what makes Nvidia unique that we can uh in the beginning when cnns were popular we were the right architecture because we were programmable Aruda architecture has the ability to adapt to any architecture that comes along so when CNN came along RNN came along Along lstms came along and then eventually Transformers came along and now Vision Transformers bir eye view Transformers um all kinds of different Transformers are being uh created a Next Generation State space uh models uh uh which is a uh probably the next generation of Transformers all of these different architectures can live and breathe and be created on invidious flexible architecture and because it's available literally everywhere any researcher can get access to Nvidia gpus and invent the Next Generation so so for those of you who are non-technical and heard you know a foreign language there with cnns and and some of the other uh acronyms that are being used the the thing about artificial intelligence is it's going through a lot of Evolutions over a very short period of time so whatever the infrastructure that was used probably 5 years ago is very different to the infrastructure that's being used today but what Jensen's point was I think it's a very important point is NVIDIA has always been relevant historically we see companies that are relevant at one phase of development and then as the infrastructure changes they become irrelevant but you guys were able to innovate and and push through let's move to a non- air related topic for a second I want to talk about education so today knowing what you know seeing what you see and being at The Cutting Edge of the technology what should people focus on when it comes to education what should they learn how should they educate their kids and their societies wow excellent question I'm going to say something and it it's it's going to sound completely opposite um of what people feel uh you you you probably recall uh over the course of the last 10 years 15 years um almost everybody who sits on a stage like this would tell you it is vital that your children learn computer science um everybody should learn how to program and in fact it's it's almost exactly the opposite it is our job to create Computing technology such that nobody has to program and that the programming language is human everybody in the world is now a programmer this is the miracle this is the miracle of artificial intelligence for the very first time we have closed the Gap the technology divide has been completely closed and this the reason why so many people can engage artificial elligence it is the reason why every single government every single industrial conference every single company is talking about artificial intelligence today because for the very first time you can imagine everybody in your company being a technologist and so this is a tremendous time for uh all of you to realize that the technology divide has been closed or another way to say it the tech technology leadership of other country has now been reset the countries the people that understand how to solve a domain problem in digital biology or in education of young people or in manufacturing or in farming those people who understand domain expertise now can utilize technology that is readily available to you you now have a computer that will do what you tell it to do to help automate your work to amplify your productivity to make you more efficient and so I think that this is just a tremendous time um the impact of course uh is is great and your imperative to activate and take advantage of the technology is absolutely immediate um and also to realize that to engage AI is a lot easier now than at any time in the history of computing it is vital that we we upskill everyone and the upskilling process I I believe will be delightful surprising um to realize that this computer can perform all these things that you're instructing it to do and doing it so easily so if I was going to choose a uh major and University as a degree that I'm going to pursue what would you give me as an advice for something to pursue if I were starting all over again um I would realize uh one thing that one of the most complex fields of science is the understanding of biology human biology not only is it complicated because it's so diverse so complicated so hard to understand living and breathing it is also incredibly impactful complicated technology complicated science incredibly impactful for the very first time and and remember we call this field life sciences and we call drug Discovery Discovery as if you wander around the universe and all of a sudden hey look what I discovered nobody in computer science nobody in computers and nobody in the traditional industries that are very large today nobody says car Discovery we don't say computer Discovery we don't say software Discovery we don't go home and say hey honey look what I found today this piece of software we call it engineering and every single year our science our computer science our software becomes better and better than the than the year before every single year our chips get better every single year our infrastructure gets better however Life Sciences is sporadic if I were to do it over again right now I would realize that the technology to turn life engineering life science to life engineering is upon us and that digital biology will be a field of engineering not a field of science it will continue to have science of course but not a field just of Science in the future and so I I hope that that this is going to start a whole generation of people who enjoy working with proteins and chemicals and and enzymes and um materials and and they're engineering these amazing things that are more energy efficient that are lighter weight that are stronger that are more sustainable all of these inventions in the future are going to be part of engineering not scientific discovery so I think we can end with a very positive note hopefully we're going to enter an era of Discovery an era of proliferating a lot of the things that unfortunately today are challenges to us whether it's disease whether it's limitations and resources thank you so much Jess for taking the time and being with us and I know that we could have continued for another hour but um thank you for taking the stage and thank you for your Insight thank you thank you [Music] everyone
