>> Stephen: HEY, EVERYBODY. WE ARE BACK WITH BILL GATES.
YOU HAVE A NEW NETFLIX DOCUSERIES THAT'S CALLED "WHAT'S
NEXT, THE FUTURE WITH BILL GATES" IN ONE EPISODE THAT
FASCINATED ME WAS YOU TALK TO BERNIE SANDERS.
BERNIE SANDERS DOES NOT SAY GREAT THINGS ABOUT THE FACT THAT
THERE ARE BILLIONAIRES. HE DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE
IS ANY REASON THAT THERE SHOULD BE BILLIONAIRES.
HOW DO YOU -- SOME PEOPLE AGREE WITH HIM RIGHT
HERE. WHAT IS IT LIKE HANGING WITH
BERNIE FOR YOU? >> WELL, HE IS KIND OF
PREDICTABLE, YOU KNOW, HE WISHES WE WERE RICH ENOUGH THAT WE
COULD BE MORE GENEROUS. AND SO YOU KNOW, HOW DO YOU
RAISE THAT REVENUE WITHOUT DESTROYING THE CAPITALISTIC
SYSTEM THAT MAKES THE U.S. THE ENVY OF THE WORLD.
FOR THAT EPISODE ON INEQUALITY, I TALKED TO MITT ROMNEY, I
TALKED TO BERNIE SANDERS. I GET THESE DIFFERENT
VIEWPOINTS. I TOLD HIM THAT I WOULD MAKE THE
TAX SYSTEM MORE PROGRESSIVE. I WOULD'VE PAID TWICE AS MUCH IN
BILLIONAIRE. SO HE WOULD GET RID OF 99% OF MY
MONEY. I WOULD ONLY GET RID OF 50% OF
IT. >> Stephen: BUT 99% OF YOUR
MONEY, YOU WOULD STILL BE A MULTIBILLIONAIRE.
$138 BILLION, I CAN DO THE MATH. >> Bill: IF YOU GET RID OF
99%, I WOULD HAVE $1.3 BILLION. >> Stephen: I AM SO SORRY.
[LAUGHTER] I WOULD NOT WANT ANYONE TO HAVE
ONLY $1.3 BILLION. ARE WE TALKING MARK CUBAN MONEY
HERE. LOVE YOU, MARK.
DO YOU THINK I WOULD ENJOY BEING A BILLIONAIRE?
>> Bill: YES. >> Stephen: YOU THINK I WOULD
ENJOY IT? I AM TELLING YOU FOR THE LOW,
LOW PRICE OF $1 BILLION I AM WILLING TO DISAGREE WITH
BERNIE SANDERS RIGHT HERE. WHAT'S THE BEST THING ABOUT
BEING A BILLIONAIRE? >> Bill: TWO THINGS.
ONE IS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY.
YOU CAN SEND YOUR KIDS TO ANY SCHOOL.
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE ANY PROBLEMS, AND IF YOU ARE
CHARITABLY MINDED, THEN YOU CAN PICK THINGS YOU BELIEVE IN,
MALNUTRITION, WHATEVER IT IS YOU WANT TO WORK ON AND YOU CAN BE
INCREDIBLY GENEROUS AND HELP. [APPLAUSE]
>> Stephen: YOU ARE PLANNING ON GIVING MOST OF THE MONEY
AWAY? YOU AND A BUNCH OF OTHER
BILLIONAIRES HAVE THIS CHARITY PLEDGE THAT YOU SIGNED.
WHAT IS THE PLEDGE SAY? >> Bill: IT'S CALLED THE
GIVING PLEDGE, I HAVE COMMITTED TO GIVE OVER 95% OF MY MONEY
AWAY TO JOIN THE PLEDGE YOU ONLY HAVE TO COMMIT TO GIVE THE
MAJORITY AWAY. >> Stephen: 51% AND ABOVE.
>> Bill: THAT'S IT. IT'S BEEN ON A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE
CONCERNED ABOUT THE RISING AI, DOESN'T FRIGHTEN YOU?
>> Bill: SOMEWHAT. >> Stephen: WHAT WORRIES YOU?
A ROBOT OVERLORD, OR THE FACT THAT WE WILL GET INTELLECTUALLY
LAZY, AND IT WILL STOP BECAUSE WE ARE OUTSOURCING TO A MACHINE?
>> Bill: IT IS THE FIRST TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS NO LIMIT.
WHEN YOU INVENT A TRACKER OR CELL PHONE, YOU FIGURE OUT,
OKAY, WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW THAT'S GOING TO CHANGE LIFE.
HERE WHERE THE AI IS VERY INTELLIGENT AND WHEN YOU PUT A
ROBOTIC FORMULA, IT CAN DO A LOT A BLUE-COLLAR AND WHITE-COLLAR
JOBS, THE FACT THAT THAT IS HAPPENING OVER THE NEXT DECADE,
THE IDEA OF DOING REALLY TRUST GOVERNMENT TO ADJUST THE TAX
POLICIES AND MAKE SURE THAT OKAY, WE ARE SHORTENING THE WORK
WEEK, SO THAT IT IS HAPPENING VERY FAST AND IT IS UNLIMITED.
A LOT OF IT IS SUPER GOOD. LIKE, YOU KNOW, INNER-CITY
PERSONAL TUTORS FOR ALL OF THE KIDS.
GREAT HEALTH CARE, EVEN IN POOR COUNTRIES.
SO THE GOOD STUFF, WHICH MAYBE GETS CROWDED OUT BY THESE FEARS,
THAT'S SO EXCITING. >> Stephen: THAT'S NOT A
PERSONAL RELATIONSHIP. IT IS AI THAT REMINDS ME OF THE
CRUEL EXPERIENCES WITH THE BABY MONKEYS THAT HAD A BOTTLE
WRAPPED UP IN CARPET TO SIMULATE MOMMY AND I'LL BOTTLE ON A WIRE
FRAME, AND THEY GOT FOOD, BUT THE WIREFRAME MONKEYS DIED FROM
THE LACK OF WARMTH FROM THE PHYSICAL MOTHER.
AN AI TEACHER IS NOT A HUMAN BEING WHO CAN PERCEIVE MY NEEDS.
AND EVEN THOUGH THERE IS NO BEDSIDE MANNER, ISN'T THERE A
LITTLE BIT OF A DANGER THERE? >> Bill: PROBABLY NOT.
[LAUGHS] >> Stephen: I HAD EXAMPLES.
YOU JUST SAID "NO." [APPLAUSE]
>> Bill: THE IDEAL FOR LEARNING IS TO HAVE A PERSONAL
TUTOR WHO UNDERSTANDS YOUR MOTIVATION, WHO IS SEEING WHAT
YOU ARE GETTING RIGHT AND WRONG, AND THE AI CAN LEARN FROM THE
VERY BEST PERSONAL TUTORS. UNTIL YOU USE THIS STUFF, IT IS
PRETTY SURPRISING. IT WAS TWO YEARS AGO WHEN I
FIRST SAW THIS ChatGPT AND IT WAS KIND OF MIND-BLOWING,
BECAUSE IT CAME ALL OF A SUDDEN. AND YES, ITS ABILITY TO LEARN
FROM THE BEST AND PROVIDE ADVICE.
AND BE THERE 24 HOURS A DAY, HAVE YOUR MENTAL HEALTH ADVISER
24 HOURS A DAY, YOUR PERSONAL TUTOR MEET AND GIVE YOU
FEEDBACK, IT IS -- THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF SCIENCE MOVIES LIKE
"HER" WHERE YOU REALLY ARE CONNECTED.
>> Stephen: THANKS SO MUCH FOR STOPPING BY AND YOUR EFFORTS TO
MAKE IT A BETTER PLANET! YOU CAN READ THE 2024
"GOALKEEPERS" REPORT ON THE BILL AND MELINDA GATES
FOUNDATION WEBSITE. BILL GATES, EVERYBODY.
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH JANE GOODALL.
