there aren't many cities in the world with Wilderness on their doorstep but this is the African Savannah so five Rhino big train bridge in the distance and uh just in that direction there you got the City Heights of Nairobi as the human population has grown wild animals have been forced to share their spaces but while the physical distance might have married there remains a gap between their world and ours it's a hippo or at least we think there is oh there's another one there we haven't exactly been able to ask what they think unbelievable and then the birds here talking to each [Music] other today artificial intelligence is helping scientists to explore the croaks the chirps and the hounds that pass between and across different species revealing Communications of Staggering complexity I'm Professor Hannah fry mathematician and writer I want to know whether we can decode the language of other species and perhaps even speak to them with the power of AI [Music] oh I can see a Waggy tail any story about animal communication should surely start with our closest Furry Friends how you doing look we're matching they might make the best companions but our conversations with them have always been a bit one-sided to show her the house this is the thing that most people are interested in this is his board this is Cash Cash has quite the social media following as he is able to communicate via buttons Grandma friend want how many do you think that he knows there's maybe 130 but basically everything over here if I press any of these we're going to see quite a large a large response the w k button is on this side okay sure and if there was hasn't learned how to spell yet no he has not this visitor the board is designed with social words like hello and goodbye at one end and verbs nouns and places at the other and according to Christina she and cash can use it to converse hey Bubba can I ask you a question do you want a bone [Music] yes yes okay you want a BN oh you clever doggy there you go swee but every dog understands the word bone right what would be more impressive is if cash communicated not just what he wants but how he feels okay so I asked him you want to be brushed right now cuz he was just hovering over this brush he said no I'm sad that didn't make sense to me so I asked why are you sad and he said I'm sick sick you're sick and he didn't seem sick uh but we went over the couch we cuddled and you're going to see him barf right next to me oh wow oh yeah sorry there is fine [Music] okay maybe we're doing a human interpretation of this but but that is like understanding your own internal emotional state do you think that actually the dogs have a much more intelligent inner life than we give them credit for he absolutely seems to care about things I never had any idea about the frequency with which my parents visit very meaningful to him if they've gone a couple days and they have not visited him I start to a grandparent requests while many of us want to believe that we can have a meaningful conversation with our parents some researchers have doubts about what the use of button boards really shows it is not an exact science by any means and I and we actually get a lot of push back on that because people want it to be very clear and very linear what I will say without a doubt is that what's Happening Here is communication and that to me is very very valuable so far little research has been published but there is some evidence that dogs can combine buttons together to create new meanings Cash Cash oh yeah you gorgeous boy and regardless of the science Christina's motivation is to build a better relationship with her dog I think cash and his relationship with Christina super cute but I also think that the jury is out on this about whether this is just sophisticated begging or a real form of communic ation what's interesting is the language because this is Cash learning English I think if you're going to claim to have really cracked animal communication I think we also have to learn how to speak dog and that is where artificial intelligence comes in the discovery of the Rosetta Stone that was the key that unlocked Egyptian hieroglyphs and the language of an ancient civilization unfortunately when it comes to communicating with animals it's unlikely that we're going to find another one but there is some hope that lies in an incredibly powerful piece of AI architecture known as a Transformer now Transformers are now ubiquitous they are the engine that drives chatbots like gp4 and they work by taking reams of data text for instance and mapping it into a multi-dimensional space a bit like a galaxy of stars in this galaxy each star represents a word but crucially the distance and Direction between the Stars encodes relational meaning for example the geometric space between Queen and woman will be the same as Princess and girl this ability to track relationships between words gives Transformers their superpower it's what helps them to make sense of things like context and structure and Incredibly if you map different languages from around the world even ones as different as English versus U they all form very similar geometric shapes meaning if you transpose one map over the other you can seamlessly translate from one language to another just like a Rosetta Stone with the discovery of this hidden mathematical structure scientists can begin to venture into an alien world to decode animal communication and perhaps even to speak back [Music] from birds to bats frogs to Humpback whales the complexity of animal sounds is astonishing research shows Prairie docks can describe what their predators look like budgies use sounds akin to consonants and vowels and with Decades of data collected by scientists just waiting for AI to decode it these kinds of discoveries could be just the beginning [Music] I mean this is an extraordinary building yeah thank you this is AAR Raskin a brain this is a a real a real human brain a real real one yeah a real real one he co-founded the Earth species project a nonprofit that tries to decode Communication in nonhuman species we work with like 40 plus institutions and like 800 biologists um and they record as you see here like video they record audio they record motion how the animals move and so what that lets us start to do is to translate to and from all the different modalities what does one whale say that causes another whale to dive in terms of the first step of that then like trying to uncover existing patterns in the data that you're collecting like do you see that there's a particular noise that whales make when another whale Dives yeah yeah yeah um this uh these are a couple Beluga communicating while hunting go on sounds like radio static right or an alien modem yes an alien modem I like that a lot yeah I mean that I could listen to that for 100 years and never make sense of it correct yeah and mind scientists haven't been able to make sense of it but we're at the cusp of having the tools to learn how to like disambiguate to like solve What's called the cocktail party problem the cocktail party problem is the task of picking out a single voice from the background of bus please could you tell me where the nearest Tube Station is I'm just not sure of the directions AI has nearly solved it for human voices but the progress for Animals has been a little slower even before you've started trying to understand what an individual animal is talking about in an individual situation even collecting the data of a single animal speaking is really hard yeah and so you have to teach an AI what does an individual animal sound like what is the syntax and once it learns that then it tries to do lots of separations and it's like oh is this a good separation so be able to translate all of that data into meaning is what enables us to start doing this kind of work it's a little bit like chat GPT uh but instead of for humans for for animals so this first bit is the prompt so this is what the bird sang and then the AI continues it it's sort of like autocomplete right for animal communication predictive text exactly right but but for birds so here we go okay I didn't to my ear I wasn't looking I didn't notice the point at which it became fake and yet does the bird notice you don't know yet like we are right at that cusp of trying for the very first time to have like AI animal direct like communication the capability to converse with animals would be an almost magical superpower but even if we could what words from our human world would we even say I think we should expect something parts of our experience to be very similar you know we all have mothers we all need to eat and we should expect a whole bunch to not be so if you're using this full AI right and it's like doing autocomplete and you have no idea what it's saying is there concern that you might I don't know like distress the animal or or sort of put them in a situation they don't need to be in yeah one of the really scary things about working on this technology is if we're not careful and we just create a synthetic whale and put it on the ocean that starts to sing like we might mess up a 34 milliony old wisdom tradition humbag whales have the ability to adopt other populations songs and can broadcast them thousands of miles across the ocean an AI whale could interfere with that communication perhaps affecting Behavior or navigation [Music] yeah eventually I think we're going to need a kind of Geneva Convention for cross species communication like this technology is coming whether we build it or somebody else in some sense it's inevitable there is an assumption here that the technology that works for humans could be transported to work for animals too but just because AI can switch from ero to Spanish translating from English to whale seems like a different kind of problem altogether it feels like there's something missing here right you know when chat GPT was trained with humans using it and assessing how much sense it made how good it was at replicating human language like we we're kind of missing the key translator who can go from one language to the other I know that that's the point I know that they're saying that AI can be the Rosetta Stone but I'm just I'm not sure that I'm convinced that our worldview and the things that we care enough about to have language for are going to map onto the things that are important to animals [Music] enough these are elephant seals for 3 months a year they lie around on beaches while the females wait for their newborn pups to be old enough to swim so what does a colony of elephant seals have to talk about in all of that time oh my gosh the light the morning so Beau when it comes down over all of these Hill siid it's absolutely beautiful biologist Caroline Casey has spent over a decad studying these creatures got a little bit of mountain goat we go jeans and has begun to discover what they have to say really it's just about sitting here and waiting you know I'll just like post up and kind of watch to see what's happening on the on the colony right now it's mating season and the seals approach to romance is seemingly well one-sided mostly adult females and then each female for the most part has a little pup with them and so typically there's one alpha and his job is to meet with as many females as possible before they depart back to seat and that's when things get really dynamic because there's males waiting in the wing for is that male over there yeah rather than heading straight into an energy draining and sometimes deadly battle the competing males call out each with a unique Rhythm and tomra this is a real simple call oh it's like sounds like someone with a drum yeah and then I love this one this one is more complex so there's like a little substructural components that hopefully you can hear oh this say on The Bongo yeah through a series of playback experiments Caroline discovered they were essentially just saying their own names they've got names exactly what that they give each other or that they give themselves they give themselves essentially we don't know how we don't know if they learn them or if they're born with them what so they come in and they're like Jim here that's the only thing they say but you need to be able to have experience with Jim to know how to respond to them but if Bob had beat you up a couple times and you hear the word Bob all of a sudden you have this association with this negative thing that happen in the world of male elephant seals who only ever say their own name it's not looking great for an AI Rosetta Stone to communicate with them but that doesn't mean that AI can't bring other benefits I would love to work with somebody who specializes in AI to see what they would find but I'm really driven by a specific scientific question you know I'm taking maybe a two-minute recording of this mail I know exactly who he is I know the context of the call that he's producing so it's not just a case of like get the data now we've got AI press the big like AI button and and there you go talk to animal I mean you you the main I'm sorry I'm just so sidetracked by how gigantically enormous that and now he's was coming up and he's like you better come into my her oh is it possible though that maybe there are things other than food and space and mating that these seals are talking about sure yeah absolutely yeah yeah I mean I would be surprised just cuz we've been studying them for so long but of course maybe they love surfing yeah of course we're looking at it through our own human length and of course there may be some subtle patterns that we're missing so I think that that's where AI can really comp compliment but it's no substitute for sitting on a JY I don't think so I think that the the most elegant and profound discoveries of animal behavior have come from knowing individual animals and watching them and tracking them and just being present I think the big thing about this project is that it's all about listening rather than communica necessarily it's all about what these creatures are saying to each other and they're only intervening to be sure that they've understood it and it does make me wonder about this idea of communication I mean here it's one way but is there is there ever going to be a situation where talking to wild animals is a good thing the potential risks from human to animal communication are far reaching whether it's causing animals distress or unknowingly impacting entire ecosystems the stakes are high if the goal of two-way communication is to actually improve our relationship with the natural [Music] world in Kenya a group of researchers are trying to do just this this is our headquarters in Nairobi in this incredible building actually it's very very old about 70 years old they have harnessed the power of communication to address the growing problem of human elephant conflict in the hope that they can prevent both sides from [Music] harm it all began after hearing indigenous folklore that elephants are terrified of bees so here we are so this is a one of the inspired Dr Lucy King hid a loudspeaker near to a herd of rest ing elephants and played the sound of a disturbed Hive of African bees the bee sound is coming from the side can you see her face she's lifting her head up her trunks curling around ears are out and then you start to see one female starts the retreat with her head up tail out she's clearly alert and she follows and then suddenly because she starts running they all start running away oh my goodness and you can see them literally Galloping away from what they think as bees coming to get them but not only did they run away but the elephants listening to bees head shook as if there were bees in the air and then they would also dust themselves as if they were thinking there are bees I need to knock them out of the air because before this moment all you knew was that they didn't like chilling out under trees that had beehives in it but this is like yeah the moment when it's like no they really do not want to be near the Beast to better understand what was going on Lucy used microphones to record low frequency elephant rumbles in audible to humans potentially there's like a ripple of panic that goes through them potentially there's some communication going on there as well and what she found was rather incredible you get back to the lab there on the screen are just ripples of rumbles coming through that have been captured there's a very specific shape to the the B Rumble and if you played that shape of sound through a very large speaker back to unknowing elephants they would run away headshake and dust no yeah so you basically get the elephant word b yeah play it to an elephant and they react as though they're bees yes and that was the absolute Eureka [Music] moment decoding this hidden communication inspired a way to keep elephants and humans away from conflict enter the Beehive fence hives or identical dummy hives are hung along a wire to create a border around Farmers crops if an elephant disturbs the wire the fence releases a swarm of angry bees sending the elephants on their way it's a deceptively simple solution and just the beginning of scientific research that could provide conservation at a wider level our interpretation of this we are passionately interested in the animal itself but then the reality is to help us save them because they're all under such threat and I guess understanding that comes through language Perhaps Perhaps you know perhaps the language might give us an insight into how they are reacting to each other we played B sounds to certain elephants and then we played the sound of samburu Warriors to another group of elephants they don't hedake they don't dust they actually run so they Rumble but they don't make a huge load of noise because they want to be quiet so like a word for scary human yes and the question is is it scary human or is it scary samuru so the threat level is different and the elephants respond differently to the threat levels yeah this is the the level of complexity that we're teasing apart now with the with the science that we can do as AI develops it will provide researchers with new ways to tune into the animal kingdom goals that once seemed Fantastical could be closer than ever and while a meaningful conversation with an elephant might never come to pass none of it will matter unless we are willing to properly engage and appreciate the other species on this planet honestly I'm a little bit skeptical about how far it's going to take us because if we do manage to get to this future where we can fully communicate with animals I'm not sure that humans are going to be that good at listening [Music] [Applause] [Music]
