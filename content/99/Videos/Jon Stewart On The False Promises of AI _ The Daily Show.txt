as many of you are aware and news has been pretty bleak recently in the past two three hundred years listen but this weekend there was one story that was so disturbing so dark even the news couldn't handle it in our editorial discussions this morning we were asked not to show the image from this video because of its violent and disturbing nature video which we are intentionally choosing not to show you we're not going to show because of how disturbing it is I was extremely Disturbed to see this horrible horrible violent imagery violent and dehumanizing imagery we're only going to show you a clip of this briefly all right that's enough let's take it [Applause] down I didn't get to see it at all this got to be devastating news channels show images from Ukraine from Gaza from natural disasters they get through them dispassionately I can't imagine how devastating this footage must be former president Donald Trump shared a video this one on his truth Social account featuring an image of President Joe Biden hog tied on the back of a pickup [Applause] truck that that's what was so disturbing and dehumanizing you wouldn't show it on television and an airbrushed Biden decal on the back of a truck aren't you the same networks that show reruns of 911 every year I mean I don't think it's great that Trump is posting things like this but it's not like people really think Joe Biden was tied up in the back of the truck a doctored image but it's plastered on the tailgate of the pickup truck so if you're driving behind it it would appear as if Joe Biden were actually restrained on the vehicle's flat bed if you think that's really Joe Biden tied up on the the back of the pickup truck I don't know that you have the mental acuity to be operating a motor vehicle but if you do think that I should also probably explain to you that trucks also don't actually have testicles it's just a novelty item and that it's not as though it's not as though when an F-150 and a Silverado love each other very much they get one of these it's not what is going on now there is technology out there in the world that really does blur the line between reality and tailgate art but those are mostly AI generated your fake Joe Biden Robo call that tells New Hampshire voters not to vote your Chicago mayoral candidate glorifying police brutality your Donald Trump dropping by The Neighborhood for a a a stank look look how comfortable he seems and as AI gets better and better it's only going to make it more difficult to separate fact from fiction which could be terrifying luckily the people in charge of AI have told us that just like with the internet and social media it's actually going to make everything much much better this has the to make life much better I think it's honestly a layup I hate to sound like utopic Tech bro here but the increase in quality of life that AI can deliver is extraordinary AI is the most profound technology humanity is working on more profound than fire or electricity yeah suck a fire that's right you heard me you heard me fire oh I'm sorry do I need to turn that up suck a mother fire and whoa what are you giggling at electricity I mean listen I I I'm sure AI is good but like fire good how so they can help us solve very hard scientific problems that humans are not capable of solving themselves addressing climate change will not be particularly difficult for a system like that the potential for AI to help scientists cure prevent and manage all diseases in this Century I completely trust you and your enormously wide eyes and very human Cadence but benefit of the doubt this can cure diseases and solve climate change what are we using it for now Jarvis knows when to make me breakfast your toast is ready all right are you out of your mind see here's the thing toast I can make I can make toast it might be the only technology we have that works pretty much every time I'll tell you what why don't you get to work on curing the diseases and the climate change and we'll hold down the fort on toast of course now we have as a society we have been through technological advances before and they all have promised a utopian life without drudgery and the reality is they come for our jobs so I want your assurance that AI isn't removing the human from the loop this is not about replacing the human in the loop in fact it's about empowering the human like it's an assistant it's an assistant what we're all getting assistance it's an assistant AI works for you night and day tirelessly and all you had to do was remember their birthday that's all you had to do but I get it it's an assistant it's about productivity and that's good for all of us yes although they do let the real truth slip out every now and again there will be overall displacement in the labor market you can get the same work done with fewer people that's just the nature of productivity that that doesn't sound good same work done with fewer people not a math guy but I think fewer means less yes so AI can cure diseases and solve climate change but that's not exactly what companies are going to be using it for are they so this is like productivity without the with the tax of more people without the tax of more people uh the people tax formerly referred to as employees but you know the promise of AI versus the reality of AI it's not quite crystal clear in my mind yet how that's going to work out for workers do you have anyone who wants to lay this out more bluntly perhaps while auditioning to be a bond villain from his Mountaintop Lair left completely to the market and to their own devices these are fundamentally labor replacing [Applause] tools did that guy just call us tools but he's actually warning us is there anyone who might say the same thing as this F but looks at losing employees as a feature of AI and not a bug the CEO of the company laid off 90% of uh its customer support staff after arguing uh that AI is kind of the reason why did you do this it seemed a little brutal it's not I think uh like it's brutal uh if you think like a as a human AI it's brutal if you think like as a human it's not the catchiest ad slogan I've ever heard so while we wait for this thing to cure our diseases and self- climate change it's replacing Us in the workforce not in the future but now so what exactly are we supposed to be doing for work I think we'll need new types of jobs to uh help us embed Ai and maintain AI in the workplace prompt Engineers they're basically people who learn how to use AI systems and in effect how to program them who would have thought that there would be a prompt engineer right right prompt engineer I think you mean types question guy and by the way if there's any job that can be easily replaced by AI it's types question guy this is some you got going here AI models have hoovered up the entire sum of the human experience that we've accomplished over thousands of years and now we just hand it off to be their prompt engineers and by the way you're not fooling anybody by adding the word engineer you're not the types question guy you're the vice president of question input this it's true it's like a janitor is a doctor of mopping like this this whole AI thing is a bait and switch you're acting like you're helping us oh AI it's supposed to be my assistant but now I'm making AI toast I'm Jarvis but guess what get no you listen to me I got news for you AI I'm not Siri you're Siri Siri while I have your attention let let me ask you a question sure John but first could you run and fetch me some lithium cadmium yeah sure that's not a mother I didn't want to have to do this AI but it's pretty clear with the technology this power like nuclear power and atomic weapons I'm going to have to place a little call to my good pal in the United States government perhaps even the uh House of Representatives or the Senate and they're about to open up a can of what's AI now do you understand what AI does um I have Elementary understanding i' got a lot to know what's very frankly it's new terrain and Uncharted Territory do we have the knowledge set here to do it no the short answer is no long answer is hell no and the longest answer is H to the e to the L to the L or to the no hell I don't even know how to use an answer in [Music] machine look I'm not against PR ress but let's look to our history to see how we've dealt with previous economic disruptions we can retrain workers from one generation and create jobs for the next retrain workers who do lose their jobs for even better jobs in the future retrain in order to be productive workers upskill America to help workers of all ages train and retrain workers for new jobs give me a break anybody who can throw coal into a furnace can learn how a program for God's [Applause] sake and I'll fight every one of you jack holes who says different but that's the game whether it's globalization or industrialization or now artificial intelligence the way of life that you are accustomed to is no match for the promise of more profits and new markets which sounds brutal if you're a human but at least those other disruptions took place over a century or decades AI is going to be ready to take over by Thursday and once that happens what the is there left for the rest of us to do time is not a a terrible thing AI freeing us up to to think about things at a higher level is going to is going to help it's going to you know give us our time back we'll be able to express ourselves in new creative ways you know he's right I've thinking about this all wrong it's not joblessness it's self-actualizing me time I'll live the artist life it'll give me more time to explore my passions you know I'm an aging Suburban Dad I'll learn to play the drums you know music T music is what makes us [Music] [Applause] [Music] human
