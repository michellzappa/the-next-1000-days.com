ladies and gentlemen welcome welcome to you here and to the over 6,000 people who have registered online for uh this evening with us thinking about uh the business of implications of AI in the think ahead series I'm Michael Jacobus I'm uh the sedon Gordon professor of Entrepreneurship and Innovation and professor of strategy I study industry Evolution value migration digital platforms and ecosystems and like getting my hands dirty on the practice side as a lead adviser of evolution limited uh Boutique advisory uh helping companies navigate disruptive context but uh also in policy uh as the chief digital economy adviser in the helenic competition Commission Now speaking of AI two years ago with uh colleagues from BCG and the Hanson Institute where I serve as an academic adviser published a study on AI where we looked at the evolutionary dynamics of artificial intelligence and we spoke of the DraStic potential changes and the possibility that AI had to create new winners and losers now this feels like ions ago because of course when it comes to AI 2 years is ions ago one thing that has changed one thing that has transformed the landscape in that regard is that we're not speaking about a eye in its traditional guise in terms of big data and analytics but we're speaking about G ative AI that has made all the difference I.E the possibility of not only seeking patents through computational statistics uh but being able to sift through text document images as we've recently seen in order to be able to provide answers that are correct given the context and this is a discontinous change it's not only a discontinuous change in terms of what the technology can do it is also discontinuous in terms of the speed with which this technology has been able to improve and it is a quick a real Tech Revolution which unfolds remarkably quickly yesterday uh speaking with uh one of our theme panelists aadada who's the head of uh product development in open AI um uh he was excited as open AI started speaking in images digesting images and I hope I'm not um traying any confidence saying that a nine digigit number of users use it during the first day and that as a statistic is unprecedented the takeup and the use of these Technologies does stand out in terms of anything that we have seen in terms of historical patterns research on productivity has started emerging and the estimates that we have seen is anywhere from 25 to 80% improvements in terms of productivity and let me note that the productivity Boost from steam engine was around 25% so we are speaking about things that are transformative and AI is becoming better being able to train itself with synthetic data without the worries that we were concerned about only a few months ago now it's clear that AI matters and I suspect that a number of you are using it if you're not using it do use it it's actually uh really fun the question though is not only how we use it as an individuals the question is not even what's going to happen in terms of the specific jobs there's a lot of discussion about whether AI will eat our jobs and even more discussion whether Humanity will cease to exist because we're going to have some uh weapons that are going to be created by those using it we'll leave it to the UK government and it's Bletchley uh Park meeting to help assuage some of these links what we will be focusing on are the business implications of AI thinking about how AI is going to affect businesses and how it's going to affect competitiveness now if you think about what people look at unsurprisingly the first thing that they look at is the way in which the use of this new technology can improve their productivity in a panel last week the CEO of turn 10 said well what I will do in 18 months is probably need to employ 20% of the engineers that I'm employing today and I will not need to have them be college graduates they're going to come stri straight out of um the school so this is perhaps the easy bit and it may even be the misleading bit and it's the easy bit because it is the pure substitution of Labor with capital and this will create inevitably some tensions the really interesting bit comes when you start thinking about augmentation I.E rather than saying that I'm going to be doing exactly the same things how you will be able to combine the processes that you have with this technology in order to add value into to the world now in trying to map it we're clearly entering Uncharted Territory but we're not without any signposts we can draw on what we have learned from previous such technological disruptions and we can see what research on AI has already found and what history tells us about massive technology changes now let me give you a few factoids that will hopefully inform the conversation and help us think about what the impact of AI is going to be what do we know about the previous version of AI well what at least we found when we looked at it considering how AI was being integrated is that AI does lead to new winners and new losers the first thing that it does is it increases the inequality in terms of the profit distribution it does help companies that are more technology uh friendly um and it also works for particular organizations and that's where our big Tech discussion comes in because AI especially now if you think about AI of the generative sort works for what is modular I.E what are specific tasks that can be isolated in the previous generations of AI you can think about the patent recognition it was great because there was a lot of discussion whether AI can work better than uh Radiologists and detecting tumor or identifying metal fatigue right now we have ai that does terrific synthesizing and by the way rather than patent recognition it does the basic creative stuff something we never expected years ago because it excels in recombinations which are at the very core of creativity including what it is uh that we teach so when we seek concrete answers when we have modular structures we do see the possibility of these massive productivity gains on the other hand what we also know is that all of these Technologies and we know that from all of the studies in terms of the previous version of Information Technology fail to deliver the long-term implications that they have when they need to be embedded why well because Technologies require a concommittant organizational change you have the possibility of doing stuff with the technology but the organization is not just the infrastructure it's not just the stuff organization are the processes the people the way that they are managed and that means that we need to rethink how we put all of these together that is why for a number of years people were frustrated with information technology we even saw that in the earlier areas of AI what we will then see is that organizations will need to change and adapt their practices but this is where things start becoming a little subtler in the world of AI what else could be happening well the first thing is that we see that there are a few organizations including the big Tech mind you that have got a much more AI friendly background they've got an operating system that allows them to integrate these processes and they are structured in ways that allow them to benefit we also see that there is the possibility of a new generation of entrepreneurial firms that will come and will be able to leverage AI in order to push and challenge existing organization we know that AI is a little bit strange though it's not like other Technologies what does AI do the first thing that we have realized from the studies that are seeing the light of day is that AI disproportionately helps the worst performance now that's an unusual technology it may change but so far the Delta is bigger for the uh for the ones that are the least performing they are the ones that could leverage this type of help and we also know that there is a risk that has already started being documented of people being asleep at the wheel because they trust AI rather than using their own exercise another interesting challenge that organizations will need to look at what that means for the way that we organize and also for the organizations that are going to succeed is one of the things that remains to be seen the other thing that we see is that AI is becoming increasingly effective at Mass creative stuff at synthesizing information at contextualizing information and at providing answers it isn't yet great or perhaps we think that it isn't yet great in giving very precise answers when the stakes are high let me remind you that already the previous iterations of AI we did not want to use because if a doctor makes a mistake in a diagnosis well a doctor made a mistake and diagnosis people will die if a system made a mistake and diagnosis we are much more sensitive and as a society less willing to allow the decision to be driven without the human in the loop so we do have issues of where exactly we see the human in the loop and when the stakes are high if we're going to behaving differently when when we have creative tasks so that too and I suspect that CLA who has worked for decades in the application of Technology including AI in the healthc care sector um will be able to shed some light into that finally AI today operates as a massive demo it's been free or nearly free and we don't quite know in which way will it be monetized we have some early moves Microsoft bundled with open AI open AI continues providing its services but Microsoft also integrated in its own this morning AWS not to be left behind as big Tech is absolutely Keen to ensure that it keeps its dominance made an equivalently sized commitment slightly small with anthropic an offshoot of AI developed by the way out of people who were dissatisfied with the fact that Microsoft created this link there's a bit of irony there uh that I'm sure is not going to be entirely lost in members of the AI Community how exactly will that pan out the question of how the ecosystems that will be able to allow companies to take AI is going to be quite important and in that guard may I say that this raises issues of dominance I think that one uh of the authors of the competition and Market authorities recent very interesting and thorough initial go at looking at the large Foundation uh model is here and I think that it's a great place to look at the initial concerns in terms of competition they are also concerns in terms of strategy so we know that they're going to be issues like we saw in the previous version of AI were the hyperscalers by the way a different name for big technology firms who could see where value existed and change the foot in order to ensure that they maintain their dominance and as such cement their position are going to be very active what else will happen with us well that's where we move from the what in terms of uh gen AI to the so what so let me think about the so what and the first part of the so what for the people interested in what that means is that I think that AI will challenge entire sectors and business models so in a moment we'll hear from Beano who's the CEO spring studio in a sector who which as you guys also said uh will go into the polls in a moment maybe threatened Lock Stock and Barrel but this is not the only sector I'm also the coordinator of lbs's AI task force I am we are at least in the task force deeply both interested and concerned in terms of what AI will do for us first of all we need to ensure that the system is robust people can have their essays entirely written by uh open AI both to enter and as they are here in the school so lots of the old ways of assessing homework or trying to see whether people are intelligent on the basis of how they F in some criteria become irrelevant when you are able to use AI to create these outputs that in a time honored way have not changed in a very very long time second how do you integrate this technology we're starting to think about flipped classrooms about roleplaying with AI taking different roles and students or Executives participating and engaging because people who will be in a top business school will have a eye at the fingertips and what we need to work on is thinking about how this technology can be combined with the skills and then work on the skills that we need to produce the same challenges that exist at the level of a top business school such as ours are challenges that exist in a number of organizations the only open question is whether they will accept it or not and whether they are ready to see them now let me take a breather here because I'd like to see what you told us by looking at the polls that we had uh through Linkedin um in terms of of the key questions that we asked so let me uh feed them also to our panel um which of the following IND you think are going to be the most significantly transformed Healthcare is top clear to note um media and advertisement uh almost ties with education we're both toast bee uh and finance we don't have a finance uh representative here I think the transformation of Finance is very real will happen a slightly different way um it's interesting that I think that the large majority of you think that AI will be transformative and I think that um uh we probably agree with that and that you expect that AI will transform the entire business model by a very strong majority in addition to employee productivity and I think that all of the above are correct it will affect employee productivity customer experience competitive Dynamics and the entire uh business model and it's interesting to see that we've got a very split audience in terms of how confident you are uh for how you going to be able to manage this now over and above the high level impact which is of course massively important AI will also Drive New winners and losers at the level of the organization we do have to take these existential questions seriously we have to think about how we will integrate it for our own companies now if you are sitting there and you are part of a firm that has had some history thinking I'm now toast I'm gone well the good news is you're not um if you look at the data despite the rhetoric on this massive disruption that we have been hearing over the last 20 years the resilience in all the major indices in the stock market has been greater not smaller for traditional firms let alone extremely small movement from the big Tech firms that of course spend a lot of advertising dollars to tell you that it's a very competitive market it absolutely isn't which is uh issue for competition authorities but it is also interesting that the traditional firms have been able to adjust how did they do that well they did it because what we are seeing is that the Innovation patterns are changing so that the traditional established incumbents are able to acquire combine build ecosystems together with smaller firms and be able to integrate lots of Innovations so there is more hope if you look at what the record is and there is an interesting pattern in this version of AI that Ana perhaps uh would be able to confirm which is that some of the earliest adopters are some of the companies that perhaps you would have thought are the old economy flat-footed firms that are knocking on open ai's door saying what can we do in order to adjust so there is a change agenda and the change agenda is possible but it's also a bit of a tug-of warar of a set of new more digitally able companies as they try to both compete and collaborate with the existing um firms now enough of me and enough of the overall uh views what I'd like to do now is to turn to our panel because we've got the luxury of having um a terrific uh panel uh with us so let me start by order of um appearance first we've got um uh Arad Dar um with whom I've had the pleasure of collaborating with the last few months who is the product lead of open AI that needs no introduction and just graduated from arone program while writing uh the software that is uh transforming our society I guess somewhere between breakfast and the assignments uh that uh that he had um of course he's also the co-founder of zindler and he's got other um um uh engagements in addition to that um that uh uh turn his engineering uh training from MIT into products next in terms of the order of of appearance speaking about organizations that uh may be challenged another collaborator and former student in our executive programs is Beano who's a global CEO of spring Studios after having worked in um wpp as a CEO of Wan Thompson uh who is uh also has a PHD in marketing and has a new book on that with Philip Cotler then I'm sure that he would love everyone to buy uh and last but not least um we have CLA mortimore who is um business transformation service leader for UK and Ireland for IBM and she's a senior partner in healthcare and public sector and she's helped transform the NHS during the coid pandemic and has seen firsthand both the promise but also the challenges of using Technologies including AI that she uh is responsible uh for with here as well so ARA let me start with you um as uh one of the people responsible for building this new technology and seeing what applications it had what are the aspects of these uh Technologies of these products that you create that you are most excited about and what do you think they will do in terms of transforming how organizations are structured um all of it I have two questions I wanted to ask though is does everyone have Chad gbt okay fantastic all right and is anyone directly working in the AI World sort of all right awesome great it's good to know the crowd you know yeah um let's see so you know like I have to go back to the days how openi started um it's a very much a research it's a we're a research company primarily full of like phds doing research in computer science and machine learning and like the the focus really is pushing the boundaries of of really like scientific knowledge that that will help us uh hopefully one day Asher in the like a safe AGI and potentially safe ASI um and that is that remains our goal um Chad gbt was really an experiment that we wanted to do and and see like I I I will never forget November 2022 we launched the product and you know we didn't really think anything was going to come out of it it kind of took off and then we had to quickly hire a lot of people to keep the company going and to keep producing like good products um and it's been absolutely phenomenal um what has been phenomenal was you know this shift of just kind of introducing a new way of getting computers to do stuff for you before you needed to know programming languages we went through the whole journey of going from you know Machine level languages to very very easy languages human understandable languages like python but now you have just literally any language to talk to a computer and get the computer to do stuff for you even write code for you and that is transformative that brings in power of compute to every ordinary individual in the world um and it's a great balancer and and that's what we are most excited about um Sam went on a world tour and he had a fascinating learning that he shared with us and the learning was the more developed countries he went to he saw like a a tendency not to change or get involved into anything new and the more developing countries he went to there was a lot more interest in trying to understand how can this give us the edge up how can this be the balancer and how can this help me narrow my genie improve my HDI what can I do and the parallel is really the you know the if you look at the like the like Asia kind of skipped flip phones and I think that's the same thing that we're going to do like AI is going to become the great balancer and and that is what I'm most excited about terrific now uh let me go to bee because I'd like to look at applications so Bea I remember we were speaking um uh sometime the summer and you were showing me an advertising campaign by um a company that uh uh is in the entertainment business uh with people having fun and a very nice aesthetic product and you said well look at all this uh which these great actors in this great location none of them is real and AI is wonderful because it reduces friction and I guess the challenge is it reduces friction but aren't you friction so why is it uh if uh you can stop using uh people for the shoots uh and organizing this entire complicated production process why don't people just do that easily with the tools that ARA gives them and what will give a license to uh the creative industry to continue monetizing itself well I guess that's exactly the point right you you you've said before that uh in education and media advertising we have uh this this issue or opportunity and we need to figure out what to do with AI I guess that uh as long as it's about figuring out what to do with AI it's still okay the problem is the moment we start thinking what to do or what AI does without us that that's the the most the more interesting question having said that the more I think about it the more I call this book that I I read some time ago and uh talking about the future of business the book was like the the factory of the future will have two employees a dog and a human the human will switch on the machine in the morning and the dog will be there to make sure that the human doesn't do anything else now I I don't think this is the future but when it comes to my industry uh being the CEO of a company uh global company in the marketing uh communication sector of course I'm very conscious and I'm also very interested in understanding what's the future because you know if you we simplify the the business model of uh of advertising uh it's about content production or ideas if you want and delivery or distribution of the content technology data processing artificial intelligence machine learning had an impact in the last few years on the distribution of the content the delivery of the content and it was great everybody was very happy uh the Holy Grail in marketing is to deliver the right message to the right person at the right time so it was just great however ideation was still something that only humans could do and that was the distribution now generative AI is having an impact on the other side on the production of the content on the ideation which is exactly uh what the two of us were discussing a few days ago and so yes yes there is a huge opportunity because until a few months ago weeks ago uh to produce that specific campaign would have had you know plenty of conversations with the client reaching out to a model agency selecting some people sharing the shortlisted people or actors with the client and then we had to go back to the model agency verify their availability fly people from all over the world book hotels and restaurants and and a location and then oh my God it's raining so we need a backup location we need another day uh we need to to change all the flights and so on and so forth and today we've done the same campaign without everything else you know it's just uh artificially generated images and uh it's great yes it is however we need to rethink our entire business model so it is absolutely true that it's having a huge impact um for now what we are seeing is it still needs humans to oversee it's still okay not sure for how long maybe ARA you will tell me and please call me the day before you release the feature one week one week second uh he lacks emotional intelligence for now which is quite important when it comes to face-to-face uh uh you know interactions for example in a retail space um or when it comes to deciding whether or not you can use a chatbot so as we all know a chatbot is perfectly fine if you want to know uh whether or not the store is open or uh uh you know if you want to book an appointment but if you have uh a problem with your dishwasher and you want to reach out to the store because you've just bought the thing and it's broken the last thing you want is interacting with the chat you want someone with picking up the phone empathizing with you and providing you with a solution in 30 seconds that's exactly what we want so we still need humans for now last but not least what we're seeing is it lacks bird eye uh it's a bit silid in the way it works and so for example going back to my example if you have a campaign online that is not performing one specific ad that is not performing you know the the the machine I don't know what to called the software would just decide that since it's not performing it it has to be shut down right however having a more like a broader view you might end up understanding that it's not about that specific ad maybe there is another major factor that that's impacting the entire internet or that entire uh category or that entire business and that's the only reason why this is happening so again lacking the the broader perspective is currently an area in which we believe humans still make the difference having said that I believe that the competitive advantage and the source of value creation for companies like the one that I run and and in general for any business will lay in the ability to find the right balance between what we want humans to do and what we want to delegate to artificial intelligence robots and and softwares and machines and of course this balance will continuously be redefined so it's all about trying to understand what to do and then reassess every six months hopefully hopefully every six months the last thing I want to say and is something that I've learned working with of course my team but also with some of our clients the Temptation is to say let's do something because there is a first mover advantage to catch however this of course expose companies to a huge risk of deploying money like you know let's buy land in the metaverse six months ago and then or let's buy nfts and then you realize that that money was just wasted and so somebody might be tempted to say let's try to catch the second mover Advantage well what I've learned is that yes you can do it but trying to catch the second mover Advantage doesn't mean that you can just wait and see it means that you need to start experimenting learning exploring alternative sources of revenues and trying to understand how your company and your sector might evolve in the near future so that when the time comes for you to try to catch the second mover Advantage you are ready as a business as an organization as a company and as a culture within that organization terrific CLA let me just turn to some of the topics that bee is uh considering which is the difficulty of organizations to integrate echnology um the promise of it generally and AI in particular has been extremely elusive in the world of healthcare um and um we have had long uh for hopes that things would be transformed and some successes and some not what can we learn from what we have seen so far and what do you think are the key impediments to realizing these benefits on the basis of your experience so so I think it's a fascinating statement that you know technology hasn't had the impact in healthcare actually if you look at the NHS as you know is take the very British example of healthcare R the NHS 75 years old this year is fundamentally different than the NHS was when it started and a lot of that transformation actually is driven by technology in some form so actually the healthcare as an industry is is in a fundamentally different place and there are lots of pockets of brilliant adoption of Technology the challenge with Healthcare is that it's in those pockets and what we saw during the pandemic was a real acceleration of the opportunity for people to take on that technology within a space where we needed a solution now and the rules the rules were not off but the rules were different and so the excuses went away if I could solve a problem in a space and make a difference to the thing that was at the Forefront of everybody's Minds right now people were started to try and so in a post-pandemic world we've got a really interesting position in health where you've got these kind of we've sort of proved you can do it but now you have to shift not just the system right so there's there's all of the reasons the NHS and every organization within it is a big organization right and and moving any big organization with lots of people in it is very difficult it is also fundamentally not there to think and worry about technology it's there to provide care so the the the focus is very different within health and the people who you're working with are not fundamentally driven by what's the new wizzy Gadget and what can I do that's you know that might be what people play with on the weekends it might be what they're learning so that they can keep up with their kids but they don't come to work to play with technology as you do in quite a lot of Industries now so they they're motivated in a different way um but there's also actually the kind of public acceptability so you said in at the beginning right if a machine makes a decision that causes harm that's just in our in our minds the public perception of that is somehow different than if an individual makes that decision so the level of public scrutiny um is is much much greater another reason why it's hard but also the other thing is actually healthare touches all of us and Healthcare has to provide in some form right equal access to service for everyone and so a lot of what you see technology and AI driving is it's part of a digital Revolution so we're digitizing lots of services so how do I from a health perspective digitalized services in a way that doesn't disadvantage those who don't have digital access um and I think the but but there are absolute pockets of Brilliance and I think the the the opportunity with generative AI um I think allows us to start changing that conversation at a time post pandemic where there is huge public support for seeing change in the health system because people know that we need to do something different if we are going to persist the NHS within the UK which is a hugely kind of powerful asset that we have but also if we're going to be able to continue to manage our own health and wellness in a way that allows us to frankly get on with the rest of our lives so so actually it's almost it's very much a human question and I think it it challenges us all to look at you know the experiences you do talk about in the retail space actually how do we as Citizens accept that health is going to adopt some of those Technologies in the same way but also how do we help the how do we help the health system to create that broad access um so that those systems can be used and deployed without that inequality that that comes so I think there it's almost much it's not a technology problem there are many technology challenges there's data all over the floor um there is hugely siloed systems there's the challenge of sharing assets and Technology assets in particular across that complex system but we could fix that given enough time and money and brains it the human piece I think is is going to be that persistent Challenge and but that will play out across many Industries and and it's great to see a more optimistic note on that let me ask two follow on questions if I may um one of them has to do with the fact that you mentioned that there are pockets of Brilliance what is it that stops Pockets from being wildfires of Brilliance is the first question and the second is is there anything qualitatively different in terms of the potential application of gen to healthcare I suspect that ARA may have uh some views in terms of that as well but you know if you could start us off off so so what stops a pocket of Brilliance from becoming a wildfire um I will give you a personal opinion and I think of very often it's either fear because actually doing something within a small space sort of under the radar right is okay but but is that fear of public scrutiny um and sometimes the rules the rules say you can't do something within the system so I think I mean to your big question of what what's the kind of business model implication there are lots of reviews and thinking that we need to apply to to how do we apply the rules to enable perhaps wildfires is probably the wrong word in this context but but though but that spread from those pockets are brilliant absolutely um I I think the other thing that prevents those pockets of Brilliance from becoming wildfires is time actually people having the time and the head space to to to make the change in the way that they work to adopt those new things to to get their minds around the acceptability of different ways of working absolutely and um ala asked earlier on how many people uh use open AI um I'd be C to see how many people use it in their businesses because legal departments have actually uh to some extent come in said you're not supposed to be using that because we don't quite know what it is yet it may get us uh in trouble so you know when you're speaking about the uh issues uh about the rules and about who's going to be able to use it or not there is yet another layer and perhaps the companies that uh knock the door of open AI are not the most representative companies in the economy and then there's an interesting question of the things that hold us back but I wanted to to to go back and and and ala return to something that you mentioned earlier on of the differences that you saw geographically in the previous study that we do did with with with uh uh the bhi BCG uh we found significant differences in the E AI ecosystem in China in Europe and in the United States um and there it goes very sort of deep um Europe you still see the the fear of vazi and um the postc world war and you know non- libertarian uh government and government should not be snooping um whereas in China there is also a different sense of the individual versus the collective let alone the power of the Chinese Communist party uh that changes the willingness to accept AI so in China we saw a drastic difference you know 70 80% were happy to be snooped by AI in Europe much less the US very very much closer to Europe but in a slightly different libertarian as opposed to individual civil Freedom uh kind of attitude but you know U uh again uh significant concerns so um we are now addressing some of these questions about what is perhaps hindering our being able to adopt it and some of them will differ by companies other will differ by countries what is it that you have seen either in terms of the difference by countries is all Difference by those who tend to be excited uh that say oh that's great and we will integrate it as opposed to interesting but I don't know you know we probably want to keep away from that y I think like challenging the status quo is always tough right so and and what we see over and over again and this is not like an open AI think I'm going to give you my personal opinion um we are always rooted in all this construction like everything that you see around us like we came up with this someone woke up and said we need to work 5 days a week to make living right like someone woke up and says we're going to have seven days a week like in the Gregorian calendar right and then there are a whole bunch of different calendars by the way um my definition of a good life would be to hang out with my wife and my dog at the beach work two days of War week and make a decent living and and that would be fantastic so I think like to make to really understand a future with AI we need to be willing and ready to rethink how we live our lives at the most Foundation at at the foundation of things and and that is tough because change is tough it it bothers us we have routines that we need to follow and whenever our routines are shaken we get really really nervous and and we need those kind of like we need a calendar to tell us how to live our life um like why can't we have businesses that that uh is able to deliver you know like 10 times the number of clients make tremendous amount of Revenue but do it by working 25% versus how much you work now as long as we are able to redistribute that wealth and not hoard it but that's a totally different that's a that's a different that's a different problem but even then you're going to see individuals in in firms who are going to be really good at prompting there'll be some who are not going to be good at prompting at the end of the day we have an innate need to stand out so we'll still figure out ways to stand out but I think I I have a problem with this um this is the status quo and everything has to fit into the status quo that's not how the world evolves um shocks are brought into the system and a few are going to stand up and say I'm going to I'm willing to rethink how I run my life and they become examples some of them totally fail on fall on their face and then the revolution stops and that's okay but I think like we need to be willing to say I live life right now this way there's a new technology what do I really care about what is most important to me and then start making decisions from there so this is prescriptive let me just push back to the description do you see any Rhyme or Reason in the variant because there are some people clearly that are more open interested to experiment and as be was saying if you don't experiment then you can't even think about how that may involve you and how you can take advantage of it but do you see any Ram or Reason in terms of either the organizations or the geographies or the industries of people who are saying you know what let's try to see how we can reimagine part of what we do with the uh help of AI is there any pattern that you can see there absolutely I think I I learned this example from someone and I love it um it's like how high on the floor are you that you're jumping from and how much you expect it to hurt right so if you think you're on the 10th floor and you have made it you're going to be much less willing to take risk and make changes and that's a representation of Highly developed economies I'm not a political scientist I'm just giving you my ideas right and if you're like I have less to lose and I really have to figure out how to do well for my population you're willing to take more risk um and that applies to not just countries I think it applies to companies it applies to us as individuals like if you are the CEO of a company and you have to bet your entire netw worth on the next big thing you're going to think like a thousand times over versus if you are like a broke college student and you want to go and start something new you like what do I have to lose like I already share my house with 20 other dudes and the worst thing is I'm going to continue having to do that for another 2 years versus I live in a mansion and I don't want to have to go back to sharing a house with 20 other TOS so I think I think that's the foundation of it it it comes down to how comfortable we are and how much it might hurt if you fail and and that drives how we decide a lot of these things uh true so let me go to a dude who does not live with another 20 people and the corporate speak but is a CEO of a company that's a bit of a tricky spot because you've got some investors um and some shareholders who are scrutinizing what you do so they may love listening to ARA but they're like man we're we want to see the results and we want to consider what you are doing for the business in addition to having fun spending spree because you just told me that there's sort of new technology how do you take the desire to experiment and try new things in an organization and turn it into reality what do you do in saying well this is a great new technology I would like to see how we'll integrate it but the CEO has fewer buttons to push than people think that they do how does it look as you're thinking about needing to keep your organization working and adjust to AI well in our case the starting point is we leave in a world where Supply exceeds demand in the majority of sectors so you still need something story a Content an efficient algorithm to let people know what are the options and likely to curate a short list of options to simplify their lives now if we assume that there are each of us is different but for some people I have zero emotional invol inment when it comes to my toothpaste so in that case the curation and the short list I'm very happy to delegate that short list to an algorithm and I'm very happy it simplifies my life Place orders I'm just happy but for other things I'm happy to have a human curation so far uh perhaps I'm following an influencer online and that influencer is recommending some products and I'm happy because I I want to follow that specific style or that specific selection now our job is to understand this Evolution and understand how people want to make their choices if at some point 80% of the choices will be automated our job is to figure out what to do so to go back to your question it's all about learning by doing an experimentation and it's all about trying to convince my people and my sholders that it's absolutely fine that we are experimenting while we are doing our job and it is the same way you would do for whatever business transformation or digital transformation as we used to call uh the process uh few years ago it's all about trying to find the right balance between some quick wins in the short term so that we try to embed techn specific technology like the campaign that we talked about before and we start delivering projects and that projects are paid so you can prove that you are doing baby steps in a direction and this is all about experimentation so that if there's a shift like a big one in the medium term at least you are equipped while simultaneously uh deliver against what you're doing now so it's all about if you want organizational ambid dexterity and uh I always say that my job is not the CEO not not the chief executive officer but it's the chief calibrator officer so my job is to calibrate the speed the length the entity of change assuming that change is the only constant so it's either we change or we extinguish so I don't have an answer but what I'm trying to do is this unbe dexterity in this baby steps and learning by doing so that we can constantly fine-tune the value proposition and I can again reassure my shareholders uh and my people that we are still doing our job while simul simultaneously we try to again experiment and learn from our own sort of mistakes or perhaps another way of framing it would be to say that we've got different time Horizons in terms of the threats and opportunities there's the short-term time Horizon whereby uh AI may affect your ability to operate or the options in which you operate you know the sort of homework example if you take an academic institution and you know the conditions that exist there so that you are running in a more efficient way while you've got the medium-term question of in which way will your skills change in order to make them relevant for techn techology correct well you have to also think about the long term what is the uh the role that you need to play in terms of society because one of the exciting bits and this is where it it becomes really interesting uh ARA that uh you speaking about essentially issues of purpose and issues of what Society um allows us to do or mandates that we do and these are the most resistant technological change in most of the world we still have the continuation here in Europe of the guilds uh which are these societies that have exclusive rights do lawyers and doctors who are the only ones who are allowed to perform medicine well right now one of the interesting questions when you have the possibility and we go back to the medican medical POS uh profession and the triage can happen as a combination of people as the NHS has already done much more effectively than it used to be uh doing a couple of decades ago having automated systems with people who don't need to have the stamp of approval of the doctor to do the basic triage and support and expand what the system does we have seen that sometimes it is the institutions that may be quite important which is where also regulation may end up being quite important not only do we have regulation in terms of AI for how it's going to be uh structured and distributed and the ecosystems and uh whether the ecosystems are going to be fair or unfair we also have regulations in terms of how it is integrated in organization so clear if we go back to examples like that of healthcare um what is it you think that will allow these new technologies and in particular generative AI to make a difference what is it that you think is the most exciting Dash the thing that that is the bottleneck that if we get we're going to be able to see yet more transformation I I think actually what we've seen with what generative AI has done which previous kind of iterations of the technology have not managed is it's captured the imagination it's it's actually you know my parents are looking at chat GPT you know my kids are looking at chat everyone is looking at chat GPT they didn't look at previous Technologies in that way and and I think it because it has captured the imagination it allows us to look at a system like the health system and not just look at how do we do things differently with this technology but how do we do different things and to really change quite fundamentally how the health system functions the big Drive in health in order to drive reduce the cost of providing Health at the moment is a shift towards what they call population Health right so actually you you start to manage your own Wellness rather than relying on the system to manage your illness and and actually generative AI creates I think a space for really accelerating that kind of conversation because it starts to encourage us to engage with the system in a different way going back to what you were saying Arch technology is AI democratizes technology and almost things that even in terms of the programmers and think about you know your own uh sort of work in programming it it feels that we we have a world whereby uh software Engineers who used to be the equivalent of tribes and medieval monasteries having the vum and being able to pass the knowledge and being indispensable will soon enough become less indispensable at least for some activities because you will have conversational ways of creating programming and leveraging Technology without the need of this uh sort of ried intermediary what do you think technology has in store for us yeah I wanted to like you know even just when we think about like healthcare like delivery of healthcare is like I would think I would in my world like it's a very small part of the healthcare ecosystem right like there is drug Discovery there is like drug interaction findings there are clinical studies these are extremely data heavy uh like I I know like scientists who have spent years just trying to do meta analysis to understand drug interactions um that is solved in 5 minutes now yeah like you can have a huge Corpus of of drug interaction studies and you can converse with that Corpus that blows my mind yeah like you can have 20,000 documents and have a conversation with a model that represents the knowledge behind those 20,000 documents that was not possible before so I think like as as you pointed out and thank you I actually like um again like going back to my original point just having a conversational interface with the computer it sounds simple that's the game changer absolutely absolutely so now we're turning to the final part of um our time together which is questions so do feel free we already have some questions that have been sent by slido if you have any questions we'll try to see whether we can put them quickly um in I'll just um uh start with questions and whoever wants to take them um uh the first thing is Will businesses need new roles to oversee the ethical and legal considerations of AI and AKA we're starting with you uh as the producer 100% yes um I think it's like a like it's the same thing if you think about pillars to support like the work of AI you're going to have someone who needs to understand compute really well you need to have someone who understands the science of deep learning someone who understands data they sound like foundational but the other two foundational areas are all things to do with policy ethical issues um understanding the boundaries of model performance U you know all things like Safety Systems those are as important as compute and data and and science of deep learning I would I would question whether it's a new role or an evolution of role and skills in many industries that are already there and and I think one of the dangers is that we put AI in a little box on its own somewhere separate and we transform the world with with that new technology box and actually we forget that that the world we're transforming is one that people have lived in for a long time and there's a huge depth of knowledge that we need to connect so I look at actually how do we evolve the knowledge the skills and complement you know perhaps some of the roles that are there rather than creating something and and avoiding the risk of re Reinventing the world especially when some of these ethical considerations have been with us for a very long time so we should not simp say I totally agree with you I think like the the huge context of knowledge that we already have is very important but there is a very important like a pivot that we need to make which is you know if you think about moderation like Facebook has thousands of people who goes and moderates post but moderating AI is totally different yeah because it generates like how it's not doesn't exist and now it exists so where do you bring in that mod um so I think there are like foundational pivots that needs to happen but totally with you we need to like build on the the huge context that we already have completely absolutely uh let me turn to um a more busy question how can small to mediumsized businesses Implement AI in their products and services without breaking the bank I think that um I you know AR if you want to make a pitch you can make a pitch now they already are um look like at least for open AI we are a profit cap company so our prices for our products keep going down and it's not you don't need to do anything fancy right like you just have to like sign up and slowly develop your prompting skills and and I have spoken to small businesses who are already benefiting um like you can never in a small business if you're running like a corner store you're not going to have a CFO you're not going to have like a you know a VPO strategy or like a chief people officer right you don't have those expertise they were not they were never even within like your reach before but now it is now you can actually maybe not the full scope of it but you can ask questions that can Leverage The expertise of all those individuals without actually having them in your payroll so again it's going to be the great balancer you're going to see Corner shops which like start actually getting into competition with tesos one day because they can do more they will have better knowledge of supply chain and they're going to be small and they're not going to go down the path of like an academic exercise to understand the impact of AI instead they're going to just go and try experimenting and doing stuff did I just use the academic word while sitting at lbs in a negative way sorry Point yeah um thoughts well there is one thing I mean we we talking about all the sort of positive implications and I I'm quite sure everybody's thinking yeah but what about the dark side so I think we should men also um but when it comes to the dark side and I'm not talking about you know jobs that will disappear I'm literally talking about very specific easy things so and again in terms of positive side it's it's incredible and I agree with you I've just finished my book and I I could copy paste chapters as soon as they were done and I will ask uh chbt to play Devil's Advocate to challenge my my sort of uh the chapter my my thoughts and that was great because that helped me so on the good side let's say positive side I'm absolutely with you at the same time I know that there are tools now ai machine learning and also sort of visual tools uh which allows allow people to I I I'm speaking a language now and I could just fill myself wait 30 seconds select another language and look at me speaking Greek uh and and my lips would move in a way that is exactly so nobody would at some point will in I would say 6 months uh understand whether or not it's me whether or not I can actually speak another language so of course I'm concerned what what if my my daughter calls me or video calls me in whatever two years and she asked me things including why don't you make me a whatever wire because I need some money and I'm I having a problem and whatever how is it scaring yes of course what we I guess what we are not equipped to do as humans and so probably it be good to talk about it is we tend to focus on the evolution of one thing and we lose track of the evolution of all other things that will benefit from the same technology so I'm scared yes if I receive a video of my daughter asking me for help or whatever at the same time perhaps in my phone there will be embedded a feature released by you guys that helps me understanding whether or not like an antivirus uh understanding whether or not that's a real content or not so I just wonder how hard it is to predict the future well and there's the regulation too right now the in China I think we had the first people imprisoned for um false information now of course the question is what exactly is false and where do you draw the lines in terms of what is false and what is Inconvenient Truth to borrow Al gul's uh U line but I think that if if you look at the the the standards that came from there they're quite interesting and quite bold in trying to resolve what will be a very real issue um there is a problem of Confusion And disinformation um which uh goes hand inand with the power of the technology and we cannot shy away from that and I think that the reason that you see everyone I know in the AI World saying yes we need regulation the question is what sort is that this is absolutely evident to everyone there and that connects to um uh another uh very thorny uh topic I don't know whether there's any views on that um how I suspect that your um uh opening I had might limit you um from answering to that which is um how you're coping with IP rights so as there are cases currently uh being discussed perhaps I'm going to uh see if anyone else says perhaps even in terms of generating a marketing campaign using AI what's the IP consideration there well there are huge C there there's a strike uh in the in the US that's been um well again it's hard to predict but it's clear that either we find a way and let's go back to regulation like some sort of water mark that says generated by humans or not which is an example of potential solution or we need to reinvent the the whole system uh what if we create a song a campaign a a script a storyboard an entire series uh with an AI that is able to predict the way uh viewers will react and it's perfectly fine tunes and and select and does the auditions and selects the right actors in a way that is just perfect it's it's already there it's already happening so I guess I don't really have an answer but the point is either we find a way to regulate and to put a water mark there or uh yeah I mean I should I should know I mean there are currently a number of of sort of big uh lawsuits going on from giab and uh there's also authors that are taking all the big um AI companies to court saying hey you used our data would like a share some of them uh say would like a percentage like we have in the case of Google and uh people that are doing the news and would like a cut on that others are saying that if this automates our job it essentially embodies our job and I think that the next few months we're going to see things that will shape the landscape and I think that this is one of these open questions because the landscape is still rather fluid it's fluid in terms of monetization and it's probably not going to stop here um it's fluid in terms of ownership and competition authorities are just starting to look into that it's fluid in terms of the uh how do you ascribe the benefits that you see and how do you pass on uh these to those who have included it uh its fluid in terms of the types of AI that you are allowed to let me go to something that may be a slightly less politically charged question um which is that AI is only good as good as a data it's being used to train it what kind of data standards can be put in place to improve reliability of AI and businesses and I think that that's that's not a totally right understanding of generative AI or or how neural networks work today um you know one thing actually I can't talk about that in too much details right now but like it's uh um we you you briefly mentioned like synthetic data majority of training today is done using synthetic data exactly which is where the model is itself classifying what is right what is wrong or what is good what is bad and uh and then there are a whole bunch of other filters that is kind of in the training run uh for such things um yeah so I I yeah I would I I I don't think that's a correct way of looking at llms today great uh on the other hand U as I did want to to to uh feel this question but I think that the question that becomes more relevant is slightly different which is that there are there is a possibility of training your um either something that you have produced or something that you have refined uh where the most of of the work may have happened from the foundation model but then you may have uh the refinement that happens from uh or the additional overlay onto your own data which then becomes more relevant to you so it's not the training itself that we are concerned with not the foundation model but what is sort of further Downstream and here there has been a question of whether that might lead for organizations that have a deeper either qualified or simply existing data to generate a better type of insight and as such improve their ability to leverage that than the other startups so um this is what I see is this very interesting Dynamic on the one hand you could say great because as he was saying this is a leveler in the sense that you've got startups with access to this data the technology is very easy to scale so you need some complimentary skills and then if you find someone with a big Bas you can tack onto them so you combine with an existing player and it's great but at the same time uh there is an informational Advantage for large players including the players that are working with you that are saying this is data that is ours and we will be able to leverage them how do you see that being played out how do you see the two forces that are essentially are the ones that are going to be shaping the competitive landscape for tomorrow ultimately being played yeah I mean really like our our third party strategy does involve like uh you know you being able to connect your data sources to get the most out of them um and it's a misunderstanding to also think about that data is automatically used for training like no we just need to have an inference from that data to to make a to make a decision on what should be the output um but you see like we're getting at the foundations again of like we are always going to every individual even without a company like every individual is always going to seek a Competitive Edge and it's going to come out in all kind of different ways it's going to be a data Advantage it's going to be a prompting Advantage um at a country level we're going to have like energy Advantage ability to access gpus having enough silicon so I think it's going to be that kind of a competitive landscape like no matter what we do right in in in some some interesting way um how it pans out like as a company we are going to try and produce the best models that are super useful um and those best models will be used by other companies who are sitting on huge Corpus of data to have their own Edge uh in the in the in the kind of like in the business world of things but I think for us what is important is the models that we put out are more intelligent more smart they have more context they have more knowledge and yeah and I think this is speak I was speaking about modularity earlier on this is the definition of the modularity in terms of a strategy we're looking at our own module we believe in the innovation of those who will complement Us in other modules we're creating an open API to some extent this may also be an interesting side effect of the model that open AI has as a result of its both Charter and sense of mission and it'll may end up being different depending on who is it that is like I can share an example and actually it's it's really related to the to the um so just yesterday or day before yesterday we announced a partn like a a new product that we deployed with Spotify where if you go and look at any of the podcasts the podcast is in your own language and to me that is great like language is an incredible barrier right now um and uh what happens is they have these tons of podcasts and you can just pick a language and the experience is not like of a subtitle or a dubbing it really feels like the accent the annotations it really comes across um and that is to spotify's Advantage they have 350,000 audiobooks they have 100 million tracks They have some number of million uh like a basically they have 70 trillion tokens worth of data and they have decided that I'm going to use that and make it more accessible using this and and and opening up like all our podcasts to 198 languages right like but what you just said really was really fascinating right because it's not about who's got the solution or who's got the data or who's got the idea it's the Partnerships and I think that's the shift that we're going to see is much much more is it's not one organization that's going to that's going to make the change it's it's how you create those Partnerships I think it will be fascinating to see how the the technology really evolves yeah and I think that's where we are going to see a lot of like very interesting IP come out in terms of how this partnership structured and where does the data sharing and insight sharing happens yeah and as I see a deep red little sign here in terms of the time that uh means that we have seconds to go I think that this is a wonderful place to end this conversation that could go on for a very long time because I think that what we are seeing is that there is a need for new sets of Partnerships and I do expect that the shape of the ecosystems will start being visible soon enough but also a need to rethink both the strategy of individual organizations and the value ad of business models and sectors we in the beginning of seeing this transformation happen I do expect that there's going to be much more about that that will happen soon uh we're going to be trying to be in the center of it here in uh London Business School uh so uh in terms of both research applied research um uh and also our programs that you can see in line uh but please be part of the conversation um we would be delighted to learn from your reactions uh because I think that conversations like these are the ones that are at The Cutting Edge and I hope that you will agree that that has been a fascinating way of spending an hour and a half please join me in thanking the panel for [Applause] traing
