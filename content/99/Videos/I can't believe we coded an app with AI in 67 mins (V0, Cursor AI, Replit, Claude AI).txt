there's two types of people who've watched my videos and message me there's the people and it's not nowhere in between either they have fully pushed to the end and created basically a full app that they love or they got stuck on like the first few steps and gave up once you get the aha moment where you're like oh this works and you realize that like you're in charge you don't need to ask anyone like influencer you don't need an influencer or a teacher you just need to ask AI you need to ask Claude be like hey it didn't work for this and it might not give you the right answer on the first try but odds are by the second or third try like you will will your way to a working app I it's guaranteed I just think it separates the high agency people and the low agency people uh pretty [Music] well um Riley welcome to the show this is a startup ideas podcast where we talk about startup ideas but we're not necessarily talking about startup ideas today we're talking about how to how to use some so AI tools to build software right yeah um it's gotten a lot easier to create websites uh whether it's landing pages all the way on the other side of the spectrum like creating apps like notion I I've been creating I mean it takes six or seven hours if you like really want to go ham to create something that looks a lot like notion but with a full database storage and everything um fully with AI without writing a single line of code so so basically a 12 billion dollar company you can clone a lot of how it works well I'll give notion credit I mean they have a lot of it's It's a the skeleton of these apps but like you can remix them as we were talking before this there's certain apps I'm like I wish I had this feature I wish I had this feature and this feature I'm like wait why don't I just kind of screenshot the app tell the AI you know this is the general uh kind generally the way that you use the app and then you can just say but I also want to have these features and then if you have the grit to push through the errors because there's a lot of Errors once you start dealing with databases but usually Claude will figure it out and the more times you do it the better you will be at like fixing those errors and and you get better at problem solving just like anything and you can create some really cool things in like 10 to 15 hours of practice and that's what we're going to do today and by the end of this video you'll have a good idea and then you can start playing with yourself and start creating software absolutely um do you want me to just hop into yes all right let's just do this okay um has there cing session this is like live cooking you're the chef all right let's let's do this here okay so I'm going to share this screen is there been any good SAS ideas that You' guys have come up with I know you do those live sessions have you guys thought of anything recently yes uh you want me to pull one up sure I mean it's like the easiest way to use these tools is if you have some sort of idea in mind but I guess without an idea in mind um let's uh I guess I'll talk about what tools I want to talk about today so this right here is v0 so this is going to be uh this is front end uh and it's using nextjs which I literally have not coded I 50 days ago I had never coded in my life so I was like the first day I found claw artifacts and then I started plugging that code into repet but what VZ does is it lets you create these really cool front ends that look amazing and what we can do is we can say I want to create an app that help me out here uh what do you uh let's let's do something let's do a SAS app um let's do like a f one of those faceless video app creators can we do something like that okay um yes that's harder but yeah yeah um what about uh what about like an app that took your transcript of one of your videos divided them into startup ideas and then made like a presentation out of them that sounds amazing because yeah let's do that okay so let's just let's this is where you kind of look at the Shell right we're not going to on vzer we're not going to be able to add any AI features because that's all going to be done on the back end so let's think about layout so like what types of things would you want if you uh if you were to talking to someone on your podcast about startup ideas what would you want to know about them so like you have your uh you have just like the idea you have I guess like business Market how big it is how small it is I like um for for me what's important is to know what are the other big audience internet audiences and communities uh in that space so that just gives me more ideas okay so I guess um let's just call it internet uh audience um and then the idea is just the uh main startup idea the market will be um Market uh Market description yes and then Market size and we can start with that because we can always add to it but I think this is a good start so I want you to create a let's call it a presentation card a presentation card uh or slide as if it was going to be in a pitch deck about a startup idea and I let's just say make it a really slick uh design uh with cool uh subtle animations could you say could you say flat design shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built hundred million plus businesses I've compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat cheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you instead of slick okay do slick slick slf flat flat is a type of design I just want to see if it it knows what that is it's a little I don't even know I don't know what that is I'm curious I'm no designer but v0 lets me offload a lot of that and it also allows me to just like take things that I like and let's see we're actually going to see it work in real time so see it's kind of nice and I like the um I like this actually so what's happening now is it's literally building like the front end for this is that what's happening yeah so we can actually see the code right here so we're going to be using nextjs I have a template that allows me to very quickly create nexj uh nextjs apps so my partner and I an who is a developer and his main passion is like teaching people how to code and he's been incredibly helpful in teaching me and so we're building the most annoying part about coding is what he calls Plumbing where you have to go in you have to set up all the libraries and you have to make sure that you're organizing your files in the proper manner and when I was first starting that would take me three hours just to get to the point where I could put an idea that I had into a website but we're actually just doing all of that work so that you could start from from that exact point where you've done all the plumbing where you still have all the possibilities you've just done all the boring work like install the libraries because vzero Opera it has all of these different libraries already downloaded which is why it can render this normally you'd have to download a bunch of things to do it because coding is a lot of just libraries and it's kind of boring um but what you can also do on VZ you can actually say make changes so like make uh changes to this card I want to uh make changes to this card I want to have a border around the edges and add uh clean add light dots in the background as if it's graph paper uh very uh light and uh what's the word transparent and I just want to go over the example that you can kind of alter these uh and it just edits these live so it'll look back at the one it previously created and it will create a new one and so this is a lot like clawed artifacts but like on steroids and this is crazy yeah so you see that if you see those dots in the background it it's kind of a nice little nice touch there and it added the nice border and so you can always go back and see so we can see this one and we can go back and look at the previous version which didn't have a border nor those dots can I add one quick thing yeah I don't know how to and I want to see how you'd prompt this so on my podcast I say either an idea is sip or spit sip is if I really like the idea like startup ideas podcast and spit is if I really don't like the idea how can we put how can we do a prompt so we can show if the ideas is is sip or spit oh wow okay we could actually make this useful um wait hold on okay what if you had um a section of your show where people submitted startup ideas to your show via a text prompt yes and then it converted it into this and then it gave you like a toggle where you could either drag it to the right for almost like Tinder for sip or spit and based on what you do there then we'll add an animation left for like we could even add a sound effect too we could do that um and uh we could even add little light background music too um let me think about this for a sec um okay see this is the fun part this is I I love this process of like coming up with an idea now I'm like thinking okay what have I done like this before um and I think I think I got it okay so let's just describe this also I use voice a lot when I'm making these so I want to add an evaluation popup and this um I want you to include an icon and just have a placeholder uh image of a person and I want this to have I want to be able to drag this icon to the left which is spit and I or drag it to the right which is sip sip is positive spit is negative sip should be a green should be green spit should be red uh add a positive animation to the entire card when it gets dragged to spit and change the color to uh change the Border color to Green and for spit change the Border color to red and we can alter these animations too um and this will just take a second to load what I just said um uh the purpose of this is to evaluate this startup idea so that I can look an idea drag it in a certain direction and uh we can label it as either good or bad which I call Sip and spit I like to make sure I give it I tell it the purpose because it will actually use that in the prompt and it might add to its creativity so let's just try this and it might take a few times to get it right because this one's a little bit more advanced that's interesting that you gave it the purpose like you really did treat it like a a coworker well it'll it knows what types of animations it's trained on data oh what's it doing down here okay okay okay hold on is this a drag oh my God wait this isn't make this a slider let's just make it a circle for now I was going to make it your face uh once we actually make it into a thing so I want to um I want to drag the circle in a direction and that causes the green or red border uh let's say the slider should be right below the card and and if you drag actually We'll add that next um should be right below the card the user should be able to drag it in either direction by the way I'm happy that mistakes are happening right now because the whole point of this video is for people to learn how how you approach problems too yeah and I think people don't realize how on Twitter in YouTube you see all the highlight reels um of people creating amazing things with AI and you can absolutely do that o I like this dude that's actually amazing that's fire all right please let me do it all right so let's see okay all right so it says great idea and then uh needs impr wait is there oh you could add like um tiar so like a mini spit or like pretty good idea and then really good idea depending on how far you slide it we could do that pretty easily um but I I like the just it's either a spit or a spit or a sip or a spit um please change the Border color depending on the way um depending on um depending on the decision made by the user and then and then the popup message you have at the bottom should be sip or spit um let me see what happens if we zoom out here oh yeah that's actually really clean uh make the line thicker and the font for sip or or spit larger I'll try that one so instead of you know I went to Computer Science school so instead of writing code what you're doing is you're speaking English and then the code is coming out I call it composing code like you're you're kind of um you're just kind of guiding it you're telling it what you want and you know what things are feasible and what what types of things aren't feasible the more you do it um and I think this looks a lot cleaner what are your thoughts on the line thickness solid yeah it's it's really nice I like that it's it's thick yeah yeah okay and then boom um all right let's just go one more one more um uh now I want to create multiple slides of this once a decision decision is made it should go to the next startup idea and then I should make uh the same decision on the next one there should be an animation once I decide sip or spit make them positive or negative all right last one and then we can I get nervous you know I'm like what what's what are they going to come up with well you can always revert like I think you can retry this I actually haven't used this is the first day I've used this specific tool but it's very similar to the tools I've been using I think you can redo it so there's not a lot of pressure unless you're on a podcast um okay okay cool let's um let's just try it wait why does it it's like reversed here okay wait let me reset this I guess and while you're resetting it I have one small design detail I would like yeah changed I really like the dots that you have in the back but I don't find them pronounced enough is there anything you can you to help me absolutely hey um Greg wants the uh dots uh less transparent so have them more prominent and also below the Sip or spit bar uh it has two labels which is Sip and spit those should be reversed they should not you have the sip on the left and spit on the right please reverse those and the anim is kind of weird but like that's okay we can always fix that later because I agree I think the dots I love the the dot look I've been using that a lot yeah it adds a nice amount of of texture yeah like even like hores or diagonal grid lines are fun too I've noticed that I will say I think knowing how to design or knowing some of the terminology is still going to be super helpful so right 1,000% no no act like 1,000% taste is everything um and it's since I started doing this I'm now paying attention to every website I don't go to a website anymore without thinking like oh my God like how are they doing this or how can I replicate this or like what other tool could I create using this design method and it's it's really fun and it helps you actually like develop your taste for websites and finding cool designs because a lot of the best designs and this applies to video editing as well it's like below the level of your Consciousness like you don't notice it unless you're looking for it and it's fun once you okay now it it's flipped everything okay Jesus um this actually looks better though um despite the the it's off right it has sip on the left spit on the right so we need to ask for one more change let's just do this and then we can move on so um sip should be on the right spit should be on the left and we're just going to I'm just going to screenshot this is another good lesson actually I'm glad this happened actually we can screenshot this and you can actually bring it up and what I'm going to do here is I'm going to draw on this and so I'm literally going to I'm not going to use any colors we've already used before and I'm just going to Circle these and I'm just going to say and then I just screenshot it again and then copy it because it doesn't if you try and copy that it doesn't copy so now I'm just going to paste that image in there um and I'm going to say you see the labels oh those are the slides I just realized what that is those are the different slides like the first one is spit the second one is did you know that or am I don't Okay no Okay so like it's it's uh what it's doing is I just realized what it's doing is it's like a um so once you go spit or here you see that it's like that's your first the first one you did right so if I go but it's reversed because they're all it's messed up so might we might so okay actually okay sip should be on the right spit should be on the left please switch them for the ones I've circled in Blue uh number those and make them gray no matter what the choice was because I think it's kind of confusing when it's like this or maybe we I don't know but let's just try this but this is really useful to screenshot because we can screenshot any website we can go to any website you think is cool and literally screenshot it and then describe like what you should do with it and you can in one minute have a working prototype for it it's not a full app because it's not storing any of the data but it is a prototype it's pretty cool all right I hope we get it on this one good so far okay looks good now if we go sip boom now one was Sip two is spit three is spit and that's it it's pretty cool pretty darn cool pretty darn cool quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com okay so now let's have some more fun here now we're going to use a tool that has been the most hyped tool since I don't know I can't even remember uh for those of you wondering it's called cursor and what I do so I have this template and you can link it below we created this template and we've basically done all the dirty work so this is nextjs which v0 is also nextjs so you can do a lot of the same things and so that's where I come up with just general ideas about interface I take a bunch of screenshots and then that then I'll give it to cursor to come up with the actual application I'll show you guys here that I actually have let's go to my other account I've set up before this episode I've set up a backend or a database storage and a database storage and authentication so signing in with Google and everything that you would need to actually turn it into an app um if you also want to gather emails or gain users that's all part of this template I don't know if we'll get there today but what I do with repet so this is repet this is what the this is what we run the front end on this is how we deploy the application and we basically connect cursor up to this because cursor it's significantly harder to deploy apps for beginners repet makes taking whatever you've created and putting it on the internet with a domain that you can share right I can share my domain with Greg and he can open the site and use the site and sign in or I can go to name cheep buy a domain and I'll show you that process it takes like 10 seconds and it's hosted directly on rep and so like 20 bucks a month or something you can host a website and get that and Firebase is free until you've reached like a certain amount of users so it's very very cheap now there's like no excuses to uh to not get like an MVP up and vzero what's the cost of like what you did what are we talking v0 is either it's either 15 or 20 bucks a month or something um my AI budget is over ,000 a month so like um I I lost track of the tools um but if you compare that to a front-end designer right $15 a month right what's the hourly rate of a solid designer probably hundreds of dollars per hour um to me it's a no-brainer so this is repet what we need to do is we need to connect it to curser I don't believe I've done that yet so I'm actually going to close out of the project I was working on before and open up a new window and we're just going to do this really quickly uh for anyone who wants to use this template this will actually be cool you can just open the template and you're going to hit use template and this will take you exactly to this page then you're going to go uh then what you're going to do is we're just going to open up Secrets I think I've already done this but you'll have to do this as well and then we're going to also open up SSH and I have more videos on this if I'm going too fast but basically what you need to do is you need to go to keys and we're actually just going to put this aside for now so we're going to leave it open with this Keys tab in cursor you're going to press this button down here to open up the terminal you're going to press command K we're going to type uh generate an SSH key for repet name it repet and copy the public key to my clipboard this seems scary because it is I still don't fully understand what I'm doing but this is how you set it up you're going to press you're going to click on whatever it generates right here right after it enter y enter enter that automatically copies this SSH key that you then add right here I'm going to name it sip then I'm going to hit add key then I'm going to hit connect I'm going to copy this connect manually key and we're going to hit open with SSH we're paste it here we're not going to hit enter we're going to press add new SSH host and we're going to paste it in right here and hit enter we're going to click the top one click connect click continue and then we're almost there you only need to pay attention to this if you actually want to use cursor but cursor is by far the most fun tool I've ever is the best software I've ever used in my life so you're going to want to pay attention you might want to try it okay so then you're going to click on this this should match uh the name of the project which it does sit pod and we're going to hit okay so now they're synced right the template that I made uh with an and he put in the heavy lifting he's a developer repet makes it very easy to share templates and makes it very easy to deploy so you can very quickly download it and you can then write code and create stuff with it the editor on cursor is a lot better so we're BAS basically connecting repet and we're connecting cursor now we've done that now we're just going to we're going to open up the files that we need here so in Source app and we're just going to hit page. TX TSX and this is basically the homepage of this of this template and now we can use the composer which is the feature that is why cursor is going so viral this basically allows us to edit multip Pages at once and so we can then come here and say and we're actually just now building this out so I'm not fully confident this is going to work but I'm going to take a risk here I'm going to say um or I'm going to just say this is a next uh JS app trying to think of how we should do this okay let's do this in order here so I'm going to create a this nextjs app and I want you to um I want you to I just don't know how we want to start like when should we add the AI features to um I'm just going to start off I want you to to uh take the uh take inspiration from and what we're going to do is we're going to use this paths so chat. MD I'll explain this after I do it actually we've used the template to create apps and when we do that success successfully with a certain prompt we add it to the project files so that other people can come here and use inspiration from the files that we've used and so the end game of this would be a blank template where you can create anything but there's kind of 30 paths you can go down of different types of apps whether it's note taking basic chat app um and so let's just say I want you to take inspiration from chat MD and let's create um a basic chatbot where the user will put in a startup idea and you will output the idea in let's go to v0 real quick let's just screenshot this Co copy this nope copy this paste that in um output the idea in text format uh in format in this met with these ideas ignore the styling I don't want to worry about styling until a little bit later I just want to get the AI text feature down so just have uh idea market and internet audiences anytime you deal with AI features it gets tough like this is when you run into a lot of bugs I mean this is a hard thing to create and so the fact that you can do it in just a few bugs is impressive um let's just go ahead and let's just see what it does so I'm going to hit command shift enter which will actually so now it's looking at all of these files which I never told it to use all of these files it's just going through right we can watch it code in the background like it's literally making changes um and telling us exactly what we need to do um now it says npm install open AI Edge okay I hope that's the right install anytime it says install something npm install open AI Edge what you need to do is you need to go to repet and you need to go to your shell and you need to paste that in right here and it does some magic stuff I still don't understand it um it's it's downloading libraries that it needs to do this action so now what we can do is what I'm going to do is I'm going to reset this so I'm going to hit the stop running and then I'm just going to rerun it and then open up the web view in theory the changes will be made after I hit save all um I'm going to hit save all I don't know if it'll be added to the homepage yet we may need to connect it the the app that it just created back to the homepage so I don't know if it's going to change anything anything so I'm going to hit save all okay it is doing something it's hard to tell I don't see any errors okay so now we have this startup idea analyzer after one single prompt and we haven't accepted those changes yet if you're using cursor hit save all instead of accept all accept all is not reversible you have to ask the AI to reverse it instead of just being able to like hit reject I can still hit reject because I hit save all just throwing that out there okay startup idea um let's go ahead and I have a startup idea for selling uh gummy bears at football games what we're testing here is we just want to know if this works right so you just put in a test idea you might want to add one other thing um what other stuff did we have we had the market um football games in Germany just to give it a market okay let's hit analyze idea so what's going through your mind right now yeah so what we've done here is in this template that we're literally making I this is one that we're like in production making and uh this was a good test for me so we have secrets in here so these are all API tokens so we have the opening AI API key the uh replicate API key so these are all tools that you can use on the web that allow you to do cool things right and a popular term is um open AI rapper and what that is is just a software that someone created and it's using open Ai and paying them a little bit every single time it's used so you're hoping that the monthly charges that you're charging people will outweigh the amount you're paying open AI for the usage basically and you can use as many of these different apis and a lot of like a tool light notion is using a ton of different apis if you if it has Google Drive all these different applications but in this case for some reason it's not working so what I'm going to do is literally just tell cursor okay when when I entered my idea into the input field nothing happened need it to generate the uh the output that we discussed and it has context of this so it'll know what you're talking about and I just sometimes add please make this happen or like I don't know you don't have to do that um and I'm just going to hit uh I'm first sometimes you're mean you're mean to to them is that what I I was hearing only when I get mad only when it's like fails 10 times in a row and I'm honest L glad this happened I have talked to there's two types of people whove watched my videos and message me there's the people and it's not nowhere in between either they have fully pushed to the end and created basically a full app that they love or they got stuck on like the first few steps and gave up once you get the aha moment where you're like oh this works and you um and you realize that like you're in charge you don't need to ask anyone like influence you don't need an influencer or a teacher you just need to ask AI you need to ask Claude be like hey it didn't work for this and it might not give you the right answer on the first try but odds are by the second or third try like you will will your way to a working app um it's guaranteed you just have to have I just think it separates the high agency people and the low agency people uh pretty well something I've noticed uh so we're just going to oh I should not have hit accept all but that's I was just going to say you slide devil you it's okay we'll we'll be fine um let's go ahead and refresh this I don't know why there's these like horizontal lines here let's that might be a function of a bad um template prompt so let's just paste in what we had earlier uh which was the gummy bears in Germany can you please use the open AI oh wait hold on uh moment incoming open AI key in your environment variable which we do it's open AI key right it should be called open AI key um it is called open AI key can we please use the I think we should make this an input field first and then use the AI features because we're going to want the AI to fill them in in specific ways well see this is the hard part this is hard to make content on this because you're um okay we need can you please add error logs to the um to the AI input field I have no way of knowing what the problem is fair request is that something you've said before um yeah so I've been doing this a lot well usually you should get an error the most annoying part about this is we're not getting any error it's just literally doesn't say anything um it should say either it should say a host of different things it should either say API is failing because like you have an incorrect API key it should literally just tell us what the problem is um but it's not telling us anything so we need to enter the sends probably going to fail analyze the idea something's wrong I don't know what's going on um hold why is there no error okay I want to change the page we'll we'll add the AI features second because I do want to add that okay I want to change the page um the startup idea analyze to just be an input field and an enter button um for all the fields uh to create um for all the input fields to create a slide that looks like this and what we're going to do is we're going to just paste this in here here is the code that I use to design this card uh based on the input field I want um this to be created for that card okay now I'm going to come over to v0 and I'm just going to I'm just going to paste in here and we'll let it because it needs to recreate it it's not going to use the code because it's already has libraries downloaded so this is fine okay so what's happening I just um I'm changing strategies here so rather than have ai generate out in text form the startup idea in the format that we want instead I'm going to create text input field so we're going to manually put them in and then we can ask AI to take an idea and in the background basically fill those in so we're actually just recreating the process if you don't know to code this is a good way to do it is to actually create it manually and then say I want to automate this process and have that whole process happen in the background so like the user doesn't see it um because I don't really know how there's a whole thing with AI and object creation it's I don't fully understand it so you can use other okay so we need to install this so let's install uh frame or motion so we're going to come over to the um we're going to come over to this right here we're going to go to the Shell because you see npm that means shell we're going to type in shell and we're just going to paste this in like this and so it's installing framer motion and loose side react which is icons I believe um we might have already had both of those downloaded not sure in the template but now I'm going to just stop this rerun it and we're going to open up the web View and let's go ahead and press save all oh brother I did something wrong this is the process oh I know what I can do okay I'm justess going to revert here I really do think we need to do better instructions from the get-go I'm just going to I'm just going to do [Music] it okay good good this is how it should have looked when we were getting errors um because this makes it very easy for us to it says we don't see frame or motion so we can just easily paste in error please advise and fix error messages are good blank screens are bad right this is what should have popped up in the dev log right we should see the the errors right here and it actually knows what to do um and we can actually just see how it reacts so we can hit uh save all and then we're going to refresh um I think it fixed one I think there was multiple errors and now we're only getting I think we're getting I think this will fix oh do I need to add oh I need to add frame or motion okay okay I'm so out of my element right now um still getting this error that's good by the way because most people are out of their element so this is bad for retention you know it's yeah but the real ones are here deep deep in this episode they're with [Music] us now we need to I need to know or now I know that what I need to do is add to the template a basically a v02 repet um uh path so we need to work out these Kinks that I worked out on this podcast or encountered on this podcast and just include it but we're here now so let's go ahead and just accept this now I'm going to hit refresh and what I want to do is we are on let's go to we are in the so we're in Source app page okay so this is what we're on so we want to stay on this page right here I want to be able to edit these on the site the existing page should be the evaluation page this is the final page where I will evaluate all of these startup ideas what I need at the top of the screen or at the top of this page is a an input so it should look identical so I should be able to add these slides in The Identical manner except I want to be able to add my startup idea to one of these cards and then I want to be able to submit it in which it will move to the evaluation stage which is part two let's just try this um okay I feel like there was a little bit of bugs on this part right here cuz like when I hit spit sip I guess that's fine I guess the bar is red um and then yeah it's still kind of buggy but that's okay yeah it's totally okay I mean just having [Music] something we're going to this is a good lesson for anyone still watching um we're going to open up perplexity here and I'm going to say give me the latest uh docks necessary for what I want to do and I'm actually going to say latest API docs for what I want to do I am trying to get open AI um chat GPT to analyze a uh transcript and fill in data based on that because the the docs are going to be different depending on like just a chat versus actually having a structured output um it's actually much more advanced than just like a standard chat bot so yeah perplexity will actually find the latest documentation it's just going to give better instructions we can feed it to cursor which will allow it to make better decisions write better code and that's a really big thing for and oh wait I need this I am using nextjs please recreate and you have to make sure that um so it should give us nodejs I believe okay so here it's giving us the JavaScript yes this looks good so we're just going to copy this whole thing and I'm just going to say here is open AI documentation all right we'll see I I've never done this before actually but I think we could figure it out okay so while we do that I'm have you ever heard of cubby I haven't so I was actually toying with this idea before so uh cubby is like a it likes you can very quickly save um YouTube videos uh and it just automatically copies the transcript and then you can like play it from any point so I can like highlight this part right here and play it from that exact part and you can highlight different parts of it but uh let's just go ahead this is a really long one if I remember okay um I guess let's just let's just see in the first 17 minutes of this one I don't want to get messed up by too long of context so we'll just copy that real quick and we can close that out um now I'm going to hit save and we're going to go to web view okay nice it's coming together please work uh we're gonna paste this in here yeah that looks about like all right so let's see um analyze transcript come on there's no way this works why is open AI giving me like no errors can you change this to anthropic please um give me anthropic anthropics API for the same name use case it looks good though like we have every we have all the shell in place like we have the analyze the transcripts right you could just like literally download your transcript or you could use a transcript API but YouTube's starting to block those like you could automatically once your video is uploaded and your transcript is uploaded it basically just automatically pulls it analyzes it for startup ideas or um I forgot that where we might actually have it just be like your viewers just uploaded but I really wanted this to work see I didn't know you can do that I didn't know you can just change from open AI to anthropic yeah I mean it's it changes the code I mean they have different documentation so like either one we're going to be downloading we use npm install anthropic and it has different rules right but I'm pretty sure I've already I'm just going to do this again just in case I haven't done it um now that I think about it I'm not sure but let's go to Secrets new secret value um paste that in so this is a next this is what's different than the normal projects that I've been creating why is this giving me no API errors nothing I want to at least know what the problem is so it's so cool it's kind of like you're you're talking to your engineer friend and they're helping you yes and the more experience you have clearly I'm out of my element because two days ago was the first time I tried nextjs and so I had a previous template that I was using with just react react and typescript and the reason we switched is because you had to set up the a full SE separate repet for a backend API but it was actually I understand it a lot better uh so like when you enter a new territory which I am right now with nextjs you get caught up because you don't know what the problem is because I haven't been dealing with nextjs problems as much um anthropic API key yes we have all that in there um let's just hit save all analyze transcript just give me an error please see this this actually lets you solve the problem we got an error so ask it to find a way to give you an error which is called error logging I think um and I'm just going to paste in this error please fix this problem insane that you can do that it's fun but it's annoying it's so annoying um and you it sometimes it leads to nothing so you got to carve out like two two or three hour more time than you think you need at first and then eventually you'll get better once you've mastered and if we just use like Python and we didn't care about how good it looks it would be much easier to create because python is very straightforward and AI is very good at creating it it just wouldn't create those you can't use v0 for python like using like it's just not compatible um okay so let's just hit um save all um let me see see here okay now let's see what the issue is um what's interesting about subcategory on Amazon analyze transcripts sending transcript for analysis see now we have better logging we can actually see what's happening here okay we're getting another error um and I'm going to ask first can you please tell me if this is the same error as last time uh if it uh and give me some more information on that then fix the error please I just want to know and we're going to run it [Music] again okay we'll try one more time please make sure that the anthropic um API response is properly parsed and be lenient I really want this to work so just make this work if this doesn't work we'll try what I said previously because I think that would work because I think it's coming through it's just failing to parse it we needed to plea with it h we needed to plea with it we needed you got personal with it yeah we need to negotiate we need yeah I'm pretty sure it's anthropic API key yeah um let's hit save all oh is this correct was that one of the ideas they talked about in the episode yeah I I can't believe I actually can't believe it it works I literally canot believe that that's one of what's a lit RP what's a lit RPG lit RPG is just this yeah literature role playing game it's like a very Niche audience that this guy Nicholas cold was talking about that there's huge opportunity to create books for and were these things that you guys talked about or is it using AI to guess wait this actually kind of cool I might use um I'm pretty sure we talked about it and did you use 250,000 per month I'm just trying to figure out what the AI is guess okay so it's literally summarizing it nice yeah okay summarizing yeah um actually I don't know I don't know if we said 250 we might have said like a 100 and I see to the side it says projected Market size by 2028 so maybe it like put some you know compound annual growth rate to it no it's good it's good you have to play with it um it's good to know which where it's um wait and so okay so okay so we can add new idea so that added the idea okay now I want for um because if we were doing it on the old template I would know how to set it up so users could literally go to a site called Greg sippers spit. comom and they could sign in and upload their ideas and then you would once you hit like you could hit like show all and then you could like go through them and see like Sheila said that had this and you could literally turn it into a segment in your podcast but I don't know how to do it with this new template um but I will get that um H let's open back up cubby let's see what happens here so let's go later in the episode and let's just grab you guys talked about multiple oh three startup ideas okay wait whoa oh it just did two in that one I think yeah it did wait so Niche Publishing House sip yeah AI powered Niche Publishing House a publishing company that uses AI to generate 80% of Niche genre books with human writers to finish the last 20% is that one you talked about okay um spit only this isn't real is it the only fans Creator book Partnerships partnering with only fans creat I think we might have said that yeah really okay damn okay well then did this might just work actually wait I think we might reach a context limit here I saved let's go to different one here let's just grab all of them um this one is the same one what's a shorter one five validated startup ideas okay so we're just going to do the first half of this one because I think we're going to get cut off actually it is anthropic it might be able to just do all of them let's see let's just see if we get an error come on no way all right it just works let's go I am so thank God I was feeling the pressure wait so now let's just change this to spit real quick okay Facebook reals optimization tool it sounds about about right wait this one was with I think I actually watched this one Oh no just kidding yeah this is this is this was yes this is from this episode Chris he did talk I just want to make sure this is right so he did talk about this okay uh let's sip this programming SEO agency franchise yes okay AI content repurposing tool that's right yes lifetime warranty product yeah all these things all right this is is working we can just go through and grab all your uh podcasts and just like see all the ideas um all right um and we won't have time for it today but couldn't you automate that yes yeah that would take a little I mean then we would need to um there's I mean that's a that's a really valuable thing and if you want to create something of value yeah it would probably take me another two hours plus another a while to debug and like I might actually need help to fully deploy it properly because that's a really hard thing like you're basically scraping transcripts then you are putting it through this process you're then saving them and um I mean actually if we had another hour I'm sure we could figure it out but let's just paste this in and let's hit analyze transcript com comment on YouTube uh if you want Riley to come back some other time if if he'll bless us do you know this one uh wait I'm just curious on which one this is see this this feels like a Cody Schneider just like looking at the transcript oh damn this just got I just uploaded this an hour and 22 minute episode and it got it went from 8 to 15 so let's just see what this looks like full screen so this is the app startup idea evaluator you paste in your transcript and then um yeah so then this is this one so you have a LinkedIn video content Agency for Founders um the AI automation Consulting for small businesses I don't know if you talked about that I'm pretty sure these are all yes okay nice all right this works um o formatting gets a little rough after after 10 but that's fine that's easily fixable yeah um yeah dude I feel like send me your invoice I feel like after this I owe you $100,000 from this n dude I'll uh I'll figure out how to deploy it we'll um I'll just like send you the the link you can use it amazing um so Greg we're about an hour and 15 minutes after we finished uh the episode but I've added the ability to just paste in a link and we can hit load transcript then I can actually type in what I want to look for so startup ideas so I kind of turn this into a general app something that I might use to analiz a transcript and maybe look for AI news or coding ideas or something along those lines but we can just paste this in and hit analyze transcript should load any second now boom so four uh total ideas extracted and now what we can do um and I just put jot like jot it down or not right instead of sip or spit now we can click this button and it actually saves it right up here so this is sponsorship Library tool and we can hit jot and we see it up here sponsorship Library tool and then if we don't want it we can hit not and we have now all done so it's kind of a full app experience I think right where we ended the episode was right when it starts to get fun because you can actually start making um smaller changes and now we can save these to your profile we could in theory add the ability to edit them so you can refine them and kind of into a little notebook of your startup ideas that you have sipped or spit it is 7:41 and we've added another update so this is where we're at now we can officially sign in uh if I refresh the page here you can see it uh but it automatically takes you to my profile the app works as normal except now we can see all sips so we can see all of them and so now every single video that we do so now if we do interesting ideas and I paste it in another transcript from Greg uh hit load transcript uh analyze transcript uh what this will do it should load in the SE all sips as this interesting idea is here so what we can do is we can hit uh so let's just sip so now there's five interesting ideas from this one so sip sip you know what let's spit this one and we'll sip this one and so we go through all those now we can see all sips so now we have interesting ideas in here where do you want to leave people you know they've watched this and there was UPS there were downs but we ended up in a high like what do you want what's one piece of advice you want to give to people yeah okay so uh I guess um I have never claimed to be an expert at this right I love learning like I love like the act of like learning things and like diving deep into rabbit holes and I'm actually just this why I've partnered with an who's very good at uh at what he does and he's an expert developer he is a senior developer in every sense he's started companies and so we're working together and we're going to try and create a community and eventually help a million people learn how to code without having to write how uh uh learning how to write code and by the time you watch this I think it's going to be software composers tocom right now it's senior uh senior s uh see the fact that I don't even know we Lally bought the domain yesterday and threw the community up and we've uh it's called software composers senior software composers and since the tool that you just saw me using was composers uh was the composer feature incursor and you're kind of just composing your way uh figuring out your way through the bugs and so we're basically just creating a community of people who want to do that we're going to be releasing very in-depth course uh in-depth courses that I'm basically going to take and and then everything that I learn I'm going to put out step by step and we're going to do weekly calls help people through their bugs and every person who joins the uh the software composers is going to get like weekly help with their projects every single person's going to create an app fully deploy it we're going to talk about stripe integration which I'm really excited about actually monetizing these apps which is actually one of the hardest parts of apps especially if you have like multiple different plans um but we're GNA talk about all of it so that's what I'm working on I'm joining like I I'll definitely join once it's live I for me all this stuff like curse or repet all these new tools like it's about getting your hands dirty and it's about you know treating it as like a creative process like even if you don't end up you know yes some of these businesses some of these projects can turn into businesses and who knows like create real wealth and everything but sometimes it's just fun to do this and and to like like you said solve problem so thanks for coming on here and uh I'll see you uh I'll see you next time yeah see you appreciate it this was a lot of fun I'm thank god it worked at the end there thank god it worked dude imagine didn't worked that would have that would have sucked there would have been no it was it would have been a buildup to nothing so thank god it worked I had I had fun doing that so yeah and if you like
