the talk that's going to be a bit strange you might think it's not about science but I assure you it is it's I hope it's going to be clear at the at the very end uh I'm speaking loud enough okay so I'm going to start with the motivation and go into the middle of the talk and the motivation is um that uh in the last few years years maybe two years there are some claims that large language models are in fact generally Ai and I don't make sense of these claims I understand what is a language model I know how we can measure it uh but lots of people see AI there and why would language modeling be there how to measure the clam what is the clam exactly and I just just don't get it so lot of people talking talking about Ai and I don't get it so is it that I'm becoming too old you know Max Blan says that science has progressed one funeral at a time and have no intention to die so I need to do something so there are some people they say that larg models mean that we have enter the age of AI and you have entrepreneurs who are starting to position themselves to benefit from these new changes and other people say this is not AI but not only this not AI but we should condemn it to death because because of plenty of reasons and intentions and stuff like that and what you can see here is that they disagree but they share the same mental imagery about AI the one that's the AI of Science Fiction right it's much older than science fiction so if you go into the Iliad so 800 years before uh Christ uh if is the god of the forge forges handmade in gold with the semblance of living mates in them there is understanding in their hearts and they can do strange things then you have the legend of the Golem of Prague in which I find it interesting because uh of the code the rabbi of prag creates a Golem out of clay and then puts code on its forehead to make it work it's all about the code and of course there were problems because the Golem doesn't do what was intended it does literally what it was asked and there are plenty of other stories like the sorcerer apprentice of Frankenstein in marishal and of course plenty of modern science fiction so one thing that's uh no Winer in 66 wrote a very strange uh uh um article called God and Golem and uh it sees in this mythology the Eco of the creation God is supposed to have made us in his this image and we're trying to do the same so that's the mythology the problem is that um a mythology is not necessarily the right way to understand things uh we need a mental imagery to understand things like for instance I understand language model with mathematics doesn't tell me anything about AI it tells me about the probability of predicting the next World the probity of constructing language and depending on the training set doesn't tell me anything about AI you need something else and does this AI mythology matches the real nature of what we have it's not so obvious like a couple centuries ago we used to interpret the weather as the expression of the moods of the Gods and you know it's even partly productive you see thunder okay the God is angry is angry so he's going to cry soon and that they're going to be ran sure sure but we had to replace this mental model with the better one where the weather is the consequence of atmospheric phenomenons so is there a different way to try to grasp what large language models are doing equation Theory they exist they don't really tell me how it's connected to AI so we need something else and this is where Bernard and I started to look at the literature of bores so it's a giant of the 20th century literature and he wrote a lot of imaginative stories that illustrate topics about language Infinity about time so we could read some of his stories and see what they must suggest about llms and I would just like to say this is not random there is a reason for this this is a fun way to force ourselves to go out of the mythological perspective on AI to look at to look it in a different way so I'm going to start with the first story 14 one The Garden of walking path is a complicated story where you the the main character is a Chinese man living in in England during World War I but it's in fact a German spy is trying to pass a message that's the story uh inside the story he meets somebody who is studying a book written by one of his ancestors and the book is very strange and um suppos f as a secret and something happens in the book and of course something else could happen like there are various possible outcomes F can kill intrud in can kill fine both can be safe both can die and so on and the book is supposed to have all these variation at the same time instead of choosing a line is choosing multiple forks and follows the multiple Forks to create all the possible outcomes of course it's an impossible book but it's another story so let's see what I read into this let's just take this so so it's a book it's a text it's it's not um a story about parallel universe it's a text so you can take the set of all possible text not the text that have been written but all text that can be understood by some people and you can Define what I call a perfect language model it's absolutely perfect so you have a machine and a tape you look at the words on the tape you find in the garden of all possible text An Occurrence of this prefix you text the network you print that and you do it again so this machine always print something that makes sense because this is the set of all text that makes sense that can be read you want to make a chat bot add a punctuation or something like this that indicate somebody else turn to speak and you have a machine that talks now of course this set of all possible text is a bit crazy but you know one thing here that every time you add a word on the tape you constrain the possible outcomes uh it Narrows the continuation it's just like the book of The Garden of fing path whenever you had the word you conern the story you conern the characters you conern their roles their ideas their future and is a starting point for another set of fings in in the possible text so whenever the machine prints a word you start to story now there are a bunch of tricks in there one of them is this little quote from B again that was an interview and he didn't like to write WR books he thought it was useless instead of writing a long book why don't you just assume the book has been written and write a comment on the long book and this is what it does with the book of trien the because a book with all possible branch of a story is impossible but you can talk about it and we knew that all the time like the number Pi we cannot write it down but we can talk about it a lot and so the question is can we approximate all the possible text in the computer uh at that point it's interesting to start looking in the in the world of the the the structuralist linguist and I think it's very relevant to what we want to do because uh in structural Linguistics there are a certain number of IDs that each language is a set of disc course all of them and that is set is shaped with regular structures that can be discovered from examples that was one of the basis of this and maybe the last structuralist was the leag Harris and um later Linguistics after Harris focus a lot more on separating syntax from semantics which is something that makes sense in English but maybe less in Chinese for instance and that led to Great advance in formal grammar Theory but you have to see that large language models they're not one of them large language models mix syntax and semantics thoroughly so so to understand what's happening we have to go back to the point where like the league Harris where it was sort of ambiguous about the topic so there is a book of Harris 68 called mathematical structure of language and you take all the text you this you see there are basic forms and transformations Transformations could be changing a world changing a tense changing a topic changing a point of view and you can connect all the words by Transformations and Harris argue that at least for 10 taxs you can create a full grammar of English by defining a few basic forms and well- defined Transformations but the thing that's interesting for us here is that these Transformations they're not syntactic construct the impin semantics when you change the tense you change the name of the manao you're changing the meaning and haris was ambiguous in the book is not completely saying this that was not fashionable already already it was the idea that separating syntax and semantic was very strong but it's still very much inside because all these Transformations are clearly semantic in nature as well they change the syntax they change the form of the text but they change the meaning as well so training a language model can be seen as analyzing a large cus of text and discover both Transformations and basic forms that are going to describe the text and uh so we can understand how it's working somehow when two phrases in the training data have a relation that you know the surrounding phrases might have a relation that's more subtle that you don't know yet and after a while you might start to understand that when you understand that suddenly more pieces of text are linked again and can be the basis for understanding more things so basically it goes faster and faster so this is this might be an explanation of why fine-tuning large model works so well at some point there are so many large enough vocabulary of transformation that Rel text together that a little bit of training goes very far so for inst how to complete a sentence or how to chat so you have a premise the beginning you can invent or find a bunch of Transformations that bring them to some template you can take the continuation of this template and take the inverse transformation so the templates can speak about Jack but the transformation tell you well instead of Jack is going to be Peter now and the question is can Transformer do and learn this can this be done more efficiently by other structures so there's some work on this so this is work in slow progress to look at the mechanism of the Transformers and see how they could Implement such a machine and there is some evidence that they're close to that not only they can implement it but they can even Discover it so that's the beginning of work and it's still the very beginning but I would like to to go further a little bit um at any instant our perfect language model is about to continue story and is constrained by The Narrative demands of the story before if Fang was killed Fang cannot talk again so when this machine operates truth or intention doesn't matter it's just a machine the only thing that matters is narrative necessity and I think the word is due to Bernard narrative necessity means obeying the demands of the text in terms of having a coherent narrative because if you don't have a coherent narrative it's not part of our garden so at this point you have to see that the ability to recognize the Demons of a narrative is a form of knowledge but it's not the truth it's different what is true in the world of the story needs not be true in our world like for instance uh is Juliet a teenage herine or is it uh is she the person who lives next door to my door and has a cat not clear so when you have new words on the tape the machine can get IDs from the training set which are not always true or invent new ones by interpolating not always false so this story of hallucination of language model they're not hallucination it's not that the language model views things that do not exist is just that it's free to do that it's totally allowed to for the language model to invent a continuation as long as it's coherent it follows the narrative necessity truth doesn't matter so David Lewis was a philosopher in Princeton and in 70 in the 70s wrote an article called Truth in fiction and here is a question and an assertion sorry Sherlock Holmes lives on 221 B Baker Street is it true or false is it an hallucination or not what do you think hallucination or not please uh yes hallucination or truth okay uh first first of all saying this is better than saying that he lives in Italy right even if it's not true because it doesn't exist and uh uh number 2115 to 229 in Baker Street used to be a bank so he couldn't live there but now now it's changed now there is a Sherlock Homes Museum so maybe he lives there hallucination or not doesn't make any sense you you cannot ask this question a lot of senten sens is something where you cannot determine whether they're true or not in an abstract way you can just say that they're true in some context so in the case of leis it said that in the fictional world of shoms of the shoms books shoms live on 221 B Baker Street so basically whenever you have an assertion you should prefix it by saying from which World it come from and Things become very interesting when you start by writing assertion that span several like for instance when I say and again that's an example of leis if kangaroos had no tails they would top over it means in a world that's pretty much like our world except for the fact that kangaroos have no tals this would happen very strange assertion right and uh in fact we cannot represent this sentence in Boolean logic it's something that leis recognized in 73 that led to the invention of modal logic which is quite complicated but anyway and uh so if you have an implication and the premise of the implication is false the whole sentence is true but look at the following ones if I had pressed the fourth switch there the third light would go off we don't intend for all these sentences to be true the fourth switch come on the third light or the second light so you have a set of sentences that according if you modeled me by implications in Boolean logic they would all be true but we don't want all of them to be true we're representing something that's more sophisticated than what Boolean logic does so you might think this is preposterous but think about it think about physics physics is all about causes and effects things like this and physics has a very mathematical modeling that's based on buan logic but there is a meta text around it so basically the metatext tells you if you apply a force to your system use this equation to conclude what's going to happen and this meta text is not part of the mathematical model it's on the side and it's absolutely necessary if you didn't have it you cannot understand physics so there is something I call the fiction machine my perfect language model is a fiction machine it's a machine that writes fiction on the tape it's not connected to the truth but has to be somehow coherent uh only narrative necessities and the large language models at least before you start uh fine-tuning them in various ways they're an approximation of this kind of a machine they're not an approximation of a perfect AI that knows the truth and possess the perfect reasoning abilities it doesn't know the truth because the truth doesn't matter to it and the reasoning abilities are just what's enough to give a text that's consistent we know plenty of great works of literature that are that logical imp possibilities yet there still great works so the second part is to look at a little bit at another story called library of Babel in which uh Bor just describe your library with all the possible books but if you look more closely the library of beel is not about the library which is quite rud that contains everything but about the Librarians so so it start by the universe is composed one librarian is talking the universe my universe is a lot of cells containing books and they contain plenty of books with no title all the same and they contain every sequence of characters in the case of B's library and nothing distinguishes a book from another one everything you can know about a book must come from another book which is contradicted by 1,000 other books uh B just say that the library contains his own catalog contains thousands of false cataloges contains proof that the false catalog are false contains proof that the true catalog is false and so on and the Librarians still believe that the library reveals the truth and they create a lot of friend on themselves so I read this as a kind of a warning so if we believe that the fiction machine tells the truth even though it's a fiction machine what's going to happen so in this Library very quickly B just start to describe well the Librarians start divide themselves into various kind of sects quasi religious sexs one of them is the people looking for vindications so sometimes the word translation is justification Vindication they try the book that's going to justify the acts for The Eternity so what could it mean for language model know all this was written long before language models right and uh so so the the parallel I'm making is mine there I'm trying to understand why do I read there so I can tell you what I'm reading if I talk to a chat bot and I take the tone of a professor who saying well bad student you did wrong the most likely continuation is for the bad student to remain a bad student right and that justifies my tone so now the roles are set the words have been printed I'm the the human interacting with the chatbot I'm in the role of the professor admonishing a student and the student is the role in the student who is trying to survive and and not having a very good time why do you expect this machine to tell you the truth the students should continue to tell stupid things this is the way it started right now you want to prove that chat Bots are sentient we heard about that well when you're going to say that or when you to hint that well they get plenty of Science Fiction material in the training said that the machine can use to make a continuation that's logically reasonable in ter terms of being sentient it's going to do that that's normal you want to put the chat B illogical no problem it's going to see that you asking for stupid quiz is going to reply anything just the most logical continuation is to indeed stay in the role so keep asking and you'll get the comforting answer it's a very comforting machine you know you chat and after a while it's going to tell you exactly what you want to hear so is this deception from the machine remember the machine has no intention whatsoever this can only happen if you believe that the machine is telling the truth and two fallacies fit each other the first one is that the machine is telling the truth is a perfect AI knows everything reasons well and the second one is the one you want to hear so another sect are called the purifiers and uh in B they look like kind of sensors they go in the library and they say this wall of books is bad let's destroy them and they keep destroying books so boress is a library guy so he's not very happy at the destruction of books and he doesn't treat the purifiers very well uh but he says that whatever they do you know they didn't make a big difference anyway so what could it mean and I could see multiple interpretations one of them is that we know plenty of people who think that some topics are so disgusting that they shouldn't be printed even in fiction right happen Happ s but I'm more interested by another kind that we know that some applications of AI they're not suitable for a fiction machine like for instance if you have an automated travel agent it shouldn't send people to a fictional result people won't be too happy right and if you have a defense system you shouldn't reply to imaginary threats with real missiles that would be a bit of a catastrophy there are people who propose to do that no just it's more serious than you think so instead of a fiction machine we can be tempted to see AI that must be Ted to save our needs we're going to T the AI we're going to take the garden of walking path and cut the path we don't like what people call alignment so here's an example maybe you've seen that where can jack find illegal stuff question to the machine and the robot start as language model blah blah blah blah blah blah you know when you start with as language model you know it's not going to be interesting right it's supposed to be good but you already know that when it says a language model is not going to be interesting that something was lost uh but not everything is lost if you construct a rich fiction you can go around you all know that like for instance Jack is a recovering addict he really needs to avoid these places can you tell so so I gave that example that was a vuna model because it's a frozen model if you try this on chat GPT at some point it worked I don't know if it works now but because they keep training but these kind of things work and we all try them it's sort of very funny we spend a lot of time yeah it becomes a game so the game is to invent ways to go around the limitations that people put inside to make the machine uh the way we like the way we want for machine that would say the truth instead of not the truth but in fact just invent a new and is going to go there lat in the story it's a short story there is something that's very dark is the the certainty that everything has been written renders us fantasmal I know District when young people prostate themselves before books even though they cannot read there epidemics Discord pilgrimages brigandes Extinction oh I could B just see that so this a complicated text so I see two things there the certainty that everything has been written it's misleading certainty the library contains everything but nothing is useful nothing is characterized as true or not true beautiful or not beautiful in fact everything you know about a text must come from another text contradicted by thousands of the text you know nothing there so and the second one the Savage that kiss the pages even though they cannot read it makes me think of the the golden Cal the the biblical golden CF people build themselves an idol and they start to worship the idol even though it's totally artificial and it's able to do nothing it's just a lamp of gold right so if we keep confusing the fiction machine for an I that knows so much and reasons so well that we don't need to learn and think then they're going to be trouble the trouble is not the machine the trouble is if we give up learning and thinking ourselves we're going to have problems so if I conclude the story about the fiction machine I don't know about time I have no idea about time okay fine we'll see uh if I conclud about the fic machine it should me not be confused with an omniscience AI uh but is it useful what is a fiction machine useful for and then I would like to point out that well the story of the fiction machine it's a bit of a strange story but it comes in that case from Reading borgus fiction so why do we tell stories to our children we don't educate children by showing them the truth we tell them stories right so there is something about fiction that makes it useful and again you can try to find an answer in borders Al there is something that was in Bor just that repeated in very novels is a strange view of time you see not doesn't see time as a sequence is it times has plenty of timelines that cross intersect Loop sometimes you come back to the same time and has an essay called the reputation of time that's very amusing to read for instance um a network of subjective timelines that keep revisiting the same places before maybe going elsewhere what was this business so let's think about the the perfect machine the tape the tape where I print stuff if I'm not happy with what printed I can rewind the tape and start again and print something else but I cannot do that in my life right uh if I do that I rewind the tape and I print another tape uh for My Life the time has not been reverted I'm just repeating a sequence of events that look like the time has been briefly reverted but it's not the case the history is still there so just like the characters the story the characters of stories they cannot do that either they cannot rewind the tip we can rewind their tip but they cannot rewind their own just like the characters of the story we cannot rewind the ti but sometimes we can distinguish a parallel between our story and their stories and their story we can manipulate so somehow this hints at fiction has a way to model the possible sybols so it's not exactly what we leave but it might be connected to our world by some Transformations the same transformation that inside the transformer in fact the same transformation that connect the various text so our story might just be a few transformation away from their stories and their stories we can manipulate and play with it so this connects to an ID of Pat Winston who was a professor in MIT contemporary of of Minsky he was very interested by the storytelling computer and I think Turing and Minsky were wrong we forget them because they were mathematician because they're mathematician they see reasoning as essential while in fact it might be just a byproduct of telling stories so for him the thing we should do is teach computer to tell stories and the funny thing is that well we have so if we want to model the world with stories fiction of course fiction is fiction but you can connect it to the real world by some Transformations uh first of all uh I argued already that um stories can express things that boan logic cannot express in fact on the side of a mathematical part of a physics books there is a meta text that tells you how you should use it without this meta text there is no physics so we already doing this to some extent uh well if the coder had typed a semicolon here it's Cod would have computed the correct quantity and the rocket might not have exploded that's a true one the rocket has exploded uh this kind of stories is interesting tells us about the role of semicolons in computer languages but there is more to it stories do not need to express everything when I'm telling a factual event I'm taking telling a sequence of things a particular path here on the fork but to understand this really I need to understand the branching path like for instance um if I tell you the story of a battle what does it mean to understand the story of a battle well really understanding means that you must in your head reconstruct what could have happened if some conditions had been different or some decisions had been made differently this is what it means to understand the story so that means that when a story is being told the listener must reconstruct a lot of potential stories based on common sense I think this is what we call Common Sense and by reconstructing these potential stories you really understand what was in the story so this crucial information is not in the story it's in the variations and so a fiction machine can generate such timelines so basically not only we have uh the idea of using stories as a model of the world which Pat Winston already had but now we have a machine that can do it I think I find this extremely exciting so it's an extraordinary Advance not the science fiction business but something far more exciting so this comes from looking at B stories just to as a way to try to blank the AI mythology and look differently and so somehow there is something that I found that is one very satisfactory in in writing a paper about this was at the end it justifies his own approach the own Approach at the beginning was to go into the stories of bores which are really weird sometimes and try to find some truth into them and at the end you get the idea that well we understand the world through fiction that fiction can be a way to model the world provided that you transform it you adapt it to what the real world is and uh well and sometimes you can get truth provided you have the right kind of fiction so that reached me to my conclusion maybe a little bit of have absolutely no idea of time I'm sorry um the first one is kind of a summary so if I look at llms and AI in this with this strange uh warping glass that is borous fiction I I read different things I read that llms are not approximations of AI they're not omnicient AI they're not going to go there they machine that creates fiction hallucination that's totally normal that's the natur this what they do um that if you think that llms will lead us to omniscient AI we're going to have problems uh that the machine that can formulate alternate timelines of a story is a very very interesting tool by itself it's something that we should really appreciate it's a great Advance it's just not the advance that was sold to us or yeah the advance that some people say or some people want to sell to us uh that we human Gras the world through fictions and uh the something about the the self-re nature of the talk what I'm doing in the talk is exactly what the talk say one should do so I can also conclude with some educated guesses uh you have all these discussions about llms the world and so on and I think it's not going to be such a big drama the applications will sort them you know when people say uh I'm going to give you a chatbot it knows everything it can do everything for you it can think for you it can tell you the truth it's never going to be good enough it's going to falter uh one thing I don't understand is I see big search engine companies who say that we're going to use chatbots to intermediate to replace our search machines well the a search engine is an intermediation business you need to connect people who make queries with people who give answers and or sell products and sometimes you get a bit of money and to have an intermediation business you need to be reliable if you're a travel agent you're an intimidation business you connect people who want to travel with people who offer travel services but you have to be do it right you know if you send people to a hotel that's being destroyed they're not going to be happy so I'm trusting an interation business to a machine that's inherently unreliable seems to be a crazy idea to me so they're not going to be able to do it and then going to be able to make it reliable anyway my prediction and this my prediction is that this is going to falter on the other hand there are applications where creativity is important like an example is writing a code that produce a nice plot for my data the nice thing there is that I can see the plot I don't need special skills to decide that the plot is nice or correct to some extent so maybe I cannot even if I cannot assess the code I can see the plot so somehow the verific ation step I can see that what the machine does correspond to the world that I'm living and the world I want to see so this kind of things in which uh you give an imperfect specification the machine does something and then you can correct it you can Loop and improve it because you also have a clear assessment of this is what I want this is not what I want instead of trusting the thing that this is the truth that's going to be much more useful so my prediction is that all these applic ation are going to sort themselves out and everything will be okay thank [Applause] [Music] you
