Reviewer: Zsuzsa Viola I’m a teacher of reading
and writing and a novelist. And today, I’m going to talk to you
about what that means at the dawn of artificial intelligence. I’m going to suggest to you
that your ability to thrieve as a human depends upon three questions
AI will never answer. And it’s about you, your community,
your democracy, and your humanity. But first, of course,
a story about someone else. In the late 1950s,
in the Brazilian city of Recife, a Portuguese language teacher
called Paulo Ferreira asked the local mayor for his support in rolling out a literacy program
to agricultural workers. He showed the mayor
how he employed new methods based upon the idea of critical pedagogy to teach writing and reading
with great success. Paulo claimed that in just a few months he had taught 300 illiterate agricultural
workers to read and write. The mayor was a radical Democrat. He supported the teacher’s
literacy teaching, and within two years,
Ferrera’s success made him head of a national literacy program with the ambition of teaching,
reading and writing to the 40% of Brazilians then classified
as functionally illiterate. Then, in 1964, a military junta overthrew
the democratically elected government. Brazil’s military dictatorship
ended all free elections, and the national
literacy program was stopped. Paulo Ferreira was jailed. Released after 75 days in jail,
he fled the country. The military dictatorship
had accused him of being a communist, but his real crime was promising to teach
40% of Brazilians to read and write. You see, Brazil’s oligarchical
power relations depended upon a law that stopped illiterate
people from voting. Without reading and writing,
they had no political voice. I teach reading and writing
at the University of Salford, where I lead a degree we call
creative writing multi-discipline. As you would expect, students who come
to study here are already literate. They can decode, comprehend
and spell words. But literacy is not a binary proposition; it’s a scale. The kind of reading and writing we teach
empowers students to continue that journey towards the higher ends
of the literacy scale, where reading and writing facilitate
critical and creative thinking, analysis, and self-reflection. When I think about
my own purpose as a teacher, I think of Paulo Ferreira, because my purpose is most clearly defined by the idea of empowering
parts of our national and global community to give them a voice, especially the first two university
students of Salford - many of whom come from generations
of the working class. I believe the future of a fairer society and human fulfillment
is in lifelong learning, and for many, the best path
is the lifelong journey of literacy, a journey so many of us end
when we leave school. Paulo Ferreira’s story is one
of the thousands I could use to demonstrate the real connection
between reading, writing, the health of democratic societies
and individual freedoms. If you’d like me to tragically reduce
the work of historians, linguists and evolutionary
psychologists for one moment, I want to use metaphors to help us
perceive how crucial to human civilization, language, literacy,
and the media of communication are. Think of language
as the source code of civilization, the obscure programming that has enabled
us to communicate with each other and which regenerates
and evolves as we do. Think of reading and writing as software
built upon that source code, enabling societies to store information,
develop a collective memory, solve new problems, and through self-reflective association
and inference, develop new thoughts. Think of media from stone hieroglyphs to paper books and prints
in the digital age as technology disseminating information, and enabling us to read
and write in different ways. Differences that can accelerate
change in the human world and even change the way
reading and writing wire our brains. It’s a horribly reductive metaphor,
but think of literacy like this, and you understand, not only literacy is
vital relationship to human civilization to the realms of the social
and the political, you also understand why humans
developing artificial intelligence, see the development
of large language models as a crucial stepping stone towards the goal
of artificial general intelligence, that is, an artificial intelligence
capable of performing any task humans can perform. We’re not there yet,
but it is where we’re heading. And if AI wants to do human,
it has to be able to do language. In November 2022, the world was exposed
to its first freely available, fully usable large language model,
OpenAI's ChatGPT. And along with over
100 million users to date, literacy teachers around the world
like myself logged on. It’s fair to say the first reaction
of the teaching community was panic, and not without good reason. A few months after the launch of ChatGPT, 477 academic misconduct cases
against students accused of generating essays using AI had been opened
across 40% of UK universities. Journalists put ChatGPT
to the task of passing tests. It could A sets. It could even pass a bar exam in law. Beyond education
in the field of literature, a popular sci-fi magazine
had to close its submission round when an estimated 500
out of 700 submissions were made with large language
model software. Sudowrite, a user program
based upon ChatGPT software, even claims to have helped you
write a novel, a non-fiction book, rewriting your first drafts and generating plots
and character for you. As one friend said to me,
“What is the point of you now?” It’s okay, he was a friend. I was less worried about the point of me then I was about how well
people understood the purpose and effect
of reading and writing in the life of a human brain
and in the development of civilization. I wondered what would have happened
if Paulo Ferreira setting up his cultural learning
circles in rural Brazil had been met by functionally illiterate
agricultural workers who said, “Hey Paulo, we don’t really need you - and holding up their phones -,
we have ChatGPT. We ask it what we want to know,
and it tells the answer. We don’t even have to read
because it speaks to us. And by the way, reading and writing
aren’t the only way to be clever. I can speak for myself very well without
that brother, thank you very much.” As the father of a proudly
dyslexic daughter who at the age of 11, can outsmart me. I’m no literacy snob. Reading and writing are not the only
lifelong journey towards wisdom individual agency
and healthy communities. Not even the only way to develop
a useful and beautiful brain. But as a writing teacher
and as a politically concerned citizen, I know the value that an aggregate
of highly literate citizens in our society can have. Neither I am a luddite. The educated elite who designed
large language models believe it is in itself
a democratizing force. There is little argument over the fact that large language models
and generative AI hold enormous promise to education, science, and technology. But what concerned me in the conversation surrounding
the release of ChatGPT was the way in which descriptions of what
large language models can do misconceived the process, purpose
and value of reading and writing. On one authors forum discussing Sudowrite those writers who swore never to use it
argued with those who were. One Sudowrite user
defended herself and said, “I am proud to be a criminal
against the arts if it means now everyone
of all abilities can write the book they’ve always dreamed of writing.” For me this statement confuses
product with process, destination with journey. We would not call ourselves sculptors
if we machine manufactured statues. The problem is ChatGPT and the software
programs built on it are not writing. They're not even thinking. They're giving us the impression
of writing and thinking. And when we use them to answer questions
and brainstorm, even shape our own lives, we are doubtlessly training
cognitive faculties. I’ve noticed in my own
digitally native children how quickly they absorb
diverse information. But is the process too passive as we get quick answers
and make quick art? Are we accessing the deep reflection
and critical awareness that makes us feel a sense
of our own agency of who we are, of who we want to become? Let me take you somewhere else. There’s a special kind of silence that
falls over a creative writing classroom where students
have been set a writing task. That silence is actually a sound. It’s the sound of thought
and the sound of becoming. Every year I ask my first year students simply to describe the room
they’re sitting in, and as we read out
the results of their writing, it dawns upon us that we are sitting
not in one room, but in 20. No student description is the same because surfing the language associations
of their own experiences, writing reveals the unique
consciousness of every writer; who captured the smells
in the room with disgust, who was lost in the view from the window, who was irritated
by the sounds of other students, who described their thoughts in the room,
who noticed none of these things and hid themselves behind
an inventory of objects. Every detail, every choice of word, every syntactical arrangement
reveals our consciousness to us. After listening to each other, we rewrite using the techniques
we observed in the writing of others. And when we rewrite paying
such close attention to technique, we alter our consciousness,
we experience a different point of view. But all this can only be achieved
if we exercise a muscle in our minds. That’s synaptic magic, responsible for setting down
one word after another in concert with our memory,
our imagination, our environment. The master of our mind is
a metaphor, of course, and neuroscientific understanding
of what is happening in the brain is only just dawning. But imaging has revealed
how students copying a piece of writing engage a limited part of the brain, and the more areas of the brain
begin to connect with each other when we write creatively. In one such imaging test, when the brain activity
of experienced creative writers was compared with novice creative writers, researchers found parts of the brain associated with semantic
production with meaning were much more active
in the expert writers. The expert writers
also employed a part of the brain responsible for learned coordination
which writers didn’t use. So through writing, the highly literate, experienced writers
had manifested a conductor for the orchestra of their mind, and they’d also freed up room
in their brain to think new thoughts. And when a brain is free of the effort of decoding
basic comprehension and literacy, we become fluent readers
and fluent writers. Areas of our brain are freed up to think
at the same time as reading and writing, using the information
provided by reading, writing to generate original ideas through inference, prediction,
imagination, association. As some of you will know, Paulo Ferreira, the Brazilian teacher
who had to flee his country because real literacy is
so threatening to tyrannical power, became one of the world’s most influential
educationalists through his book, The Pedagogy of the Oppressed. He wrote of an education
of reading and writing at its heart, an education that is reflective
and practice based, like creative writing. Worried about the dehumanizing forces
of neoliberal capitalism on one hand, and the nature of tyrannical
societies on the other, he described the purpose of education as humanization for the eternal
student of the humanities. Ferreira wrote, “The world - no longer something
to be described with DECEPTIVE WORDS - becomes the object of that
TRANSFORMING ACTION by men and women which results in their HUMANISATION”. Now, what Ferreira meant by humanization
has been hotly disputed. In his work the word
tends to stand as a marker for all that is beneficient
and progressive in humankind. But this is slightly flawed, depending on
what you believe about human nature. A strong willed tyrant
might be just as human, as an oppressed revolutionary leader. Tyrants don’t need to be
uneducated or illiterate, and sometimes they are highly literate. However, what is not disputed
is Ferreira’s focus on the potential of education
to help individuals in the context of their communities, discover a literate voice to ensure
they are not just shaped by the world, but can shape it themselves. As humans witnessed
the dawn of artificial intelligence I think the idea
an education aimed humanization takes on a new, less partisan,
more universal meaning. Far from wondering what my purpose
as a writing teacher is - it has never been clearer - in a world where an intelligence
with no consciousness, trained by corporations beholden
to profit as much as progress, has this potential to wield so much power. Where artificially assisted writing
will become part of our daily practice, finding and experiencing what it is
to possess a human consciousness will be critical for human happiness,
for the health of democracy, for our ability to meet
the problems of our age. A Spanish poet called
Antonio Machado once wrote: “Wanderer, your footsteps
are the road and nothing more. Wanderer, there is no road. The road is made by walking. By walking one makes the road, and upon glancing back one sees the path
that will never be trodden again.” I often use these lines
to encourage writing students as they embark on the task
of writing a memoir. The seas of memory can be challenging, but if we look into the source code
of language, we find a guide. The ancient root of the word “memory” can be found in the
Indo-European word “mermer”, which means what we cannot grasp
and which also finds itself in the word we use to describe speech
we cannot hear, like murmuring. Our memories, then, are hard to grasp, but in the process of remembering
we alter ourselves, and reading and writing offer us one of the best ways
of authoring our past, and recognizing the road ahead
is only what we make it. If we take Machado’s poem and replace the words “footsteps”
and “road” for “words” and “writing” we can better understand
the essential power of literacy and how it helps us in becoming. “Writer, your words
are your meaning and nothing more. Writer, there is no meaning;
meaning is made by words. By writing one makes the meaning, and upon reading
one sees the meaning made.” But these need to be your words. The words you make to write yourself
is to train your brain to think better. To think better is
to explore your consciousness. To possess a self-reflective
consciousness is to be human. As we progress towards the age
of an artificial general intelligence, we need to demand
the right of every person to have the power and pleasure
of exploring their humanity by authoring themselves because however powerful and useful
artificial intelligence becomes, there are three questions
it will never answer for you or me. Questions we must answer ourselves
by taking the journey. Who are we? What is our meaning? And what is our purpose? Thank you. (Applause)
