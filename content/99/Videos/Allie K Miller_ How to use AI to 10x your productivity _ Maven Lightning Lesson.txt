hello everyone um welcome welcome we're going to get started right away and we're so excited to have you here today my name is Alisa Evans and I'm Ali's director of operations um it's great to see so many people coming in please drop into the chat where you're from so we have an idea of of who you are what you're doing um would love to see and feel free to interact in that chat for the course of this talk be curious be kind uh we'll have a blast if you if we have time for Q&A at the end we'll address questions left in the Q&A section on Zoom so we'll try to get to those I'm going to hand over to Ally in one second but I wanted to give first a two-c background on our team and how were AI first so we pretty urgently pulled this talk to together and I honestly couldn't be more excited this is my third time working with Ally so I get to see how alli's brain works every day um so this is your time for a personal Peak inside to really see how we're building an AI first company of the benefits it brings to us it's completely rewired my approach to work I get to see amazing exciting data from our clients as they adopt these techniques and this isn't generic stuff this is literally how we do our jobs every single day so super honored to be here on pot of Ali's team um I don't want to waste any more time so I'll pass it over to Ally I'm know you all know who she is and how great she is uh she has almost two decades of experience advises top startups and Fortune 500 companies uh she founded and ran a multi-billion Dollar business as the global head of ml for startups and VC at AWS and I actually run the operations for that um and she's the most followed voice in AI for business with over a million followers so Ally over to you yaza um I'm also the biggest fan girl of Alisa so Alisa thank you for kicking that off um welcome everyone this is my first ever lightning lesson and we're going to be talking about how to use AI to 10x through productivity the big thing that I really want everyone to know just from this title slide is that it's not always about saving time if it was about saving time if it was about dropping your you know time input by 90% you would just Outsource your entire job that's the best way to deal with time right these gains are not just about time it's about increasing quality it's about increasing creativity it could be a hack or a tip that even just lowers your strength for us okay so I want you guys again as we're moving into this to start to you know unbury your head from just thinking about productivity as timesaving some quick caveats uh Lis already said we pulled this together literally in the last couple days so this is going to be fast and messy I have not timed this I don't have a script we are just going to be racing through these slides feel free to screenshot whatever you want share whatever you want on social media none of this is confidential I've blocked out pii so rock out with that um you guys have a ton in common we had thousands of people sign up for this webinar so feel free to meet each other in the comments we've got people from Microsoft Amazon Apple Oracle Hilton General Mills and a million other companies someone's gonna find a job during this webinar I swear uh definitely keep that track going if I mention a tool that is not me necessarily endorsing the tool I am extremely caffeinated right now so I'm going to be talking fast which is okay because we are going to be recording this entire webinar every single person is going to get the recording so take as many notes as you can but it is okay if you miss something or a screenshot goes by and you didn't get it you'll get that uh that link later today this is only 30 minutes I'm not going to make you an AI expert by the end but hopefully you'll learn at least one thing maybe several and before you use any AI tool regardless of whether I mention it or not please please read the terms of service before use just because I use a tool here does not mean that it passes your bar for data privacy or any other concerns that your team might have so that is list of caveats okay let's get going this entire presentation does not matter unless you have an AI first mindset okay so as much as I love reading about the you know newest AI tool or newest AI app and obviously I certainly share these things online it is less about the hottest new model that's a very Downstream action or activity if you are to change your behavior like figuring out how to use AI for productivity it has to be an upstream shift it has to be a first principles shift okay so this is about building an AI first mindset and as Alisa mentioned she's worked for me for five years she knows how you know this is an entire mindset shift but we are bu building an AI first team I literally require AI to be used on my team I test for it in my interview processes I literally uh Miranda who's also here I had her screen share chat TBT and just show me her entire workflow um so there are going to be teams that are not Banning it but actually requiring it I don't require it for obviously every single workflow but it is about an upstream decision that you make to turn this into an AI first mindset so I want to give you a bunch of different examples of the ways that we use AI this is going to be a lightweight bullet list and I'm including the tools for each of these so that you guys can get a sense of how we're actually leveraging AI then after this I'm going to be giving you some real examples some deep Dives if anyone saw my Instagram story last night you know that I was up until 3:00 a.m. trying to figure out how to embed a video so I could show you guys real demo it didn't work spoiler alert so everything's a screenshot um but maybe I'll be able to to post the videos on on social all right here we go some ways that we're using AI first we have a mission statement for our company to say that this is an AI first company and I know a bunch of folks just see that I post social media content but I run an AI Studio where we're building AI products we're advising Fortune 500 companies I advise and invest in top AI startups I obviously post a lot on social media and give talks and there's a whole education coming to this so there's a mission statement for that AI first um studio and that is what is trickling down to all these other pieces we record every single call that we're on if it's internal it's automatic if it's external we ask for permission there are two tools that we use there are several other in this space um everyone else on my team uses otter AI I use fireflies but a lot of great tools there we take walking breaks in the middle of the day we literally dictate our work into asynchronous tools like otter or a tool called async which has a 5 minute maximum so if you're doing something long use otter and we will go on this walk and dictate you know an entire business memo an entire email uh our entire to-do list and then use that to um then put it into chat GPT or CLA or any of these to actually get work out of it we build gpts like you wouldn't believe for repeated tasks I've posted this online before but my team is on chat upt team it is $30 per person per month the normal Chad gbt plus is $20 per person per month there's also Chad gbt Enterprise if you have at least 150 people we're on that middle one where it's between two people and or three people I think and 150 people and that has a higher bar for data privacy um any of the chats does not go back to train the model so I feel comfortable um doing that for my team and notably when we build gpts it is only for our team we have a couple that we share publicly but the majority of them are just for our team and I'll share one example later on of a real gbt that we built we use AI research tools like elicit and perplexity we have automation triggers like slack Bots or zappier uh make.com is very popular we don't use make but a bunch of others do I have built a hilarious number of Apple shortcuts I just shared one uh last week that I built because it was so sunny outside and I was pissed that I missed this beautiful sunny day and I was you know like my apartment doesn't get much light so I uh set up a bot that literally texts me if it's above 55 degrees and uses chat GPT and my preferences to give me a list of three things to do that day um so we have these but for work we use a ton of AI tools for social media descript I've posted about this one a lot you can basically edit a video as if it's a podcast c as if it's like editing a Word document super easy I use cap cut for a ton of my social content to automatically generate captions we use canva for a lot of our social work um and so those would be some some top recommendations we use AI writing for things like contract creation or business memos um we have rules internally about pii where we're still not putting in pii or client confidential data into these um but the ability to use a GPT that just creates contracts it's like contract automation um it saves Us hours every single time we're having a negotiation AI speech ification for learning this one we use a little bit less but there's an app called speechify that kind of just reads an article out loud reads an email out loud so that if you want to turn an article into a podcast um you would use something like speechify you can pick the voice you can have some fun with it but super super helpful if you're trying to catch up on something long and you don't want to be at your computer we use code interpreter for Mass data analysis um pretty much everyone on my team is a wiiz at data analysis I still can't remember how to do vlookup so I use code interpreter for things like um you know how what's a Google sheet formula to be able to do this uh we build quick MVPs of products with apps there are a lot of no code products out there if you want to use it um I've got Alex Weeden in the chat who is a brilliant senior mle who can maybe answer some questions there and we also do quick web page MVPs when we're building out new things so this is a very fast walkthrough of a couple of the ways that we're using Ai and I hope that maybe even just this slide alone inspired you for some new use cases because this is a big mindset shift I want to show you some before and after of like what a workflow looked like like pre Ai and now with AI so first example is going to be writing a business memo before we had chat GPT and all these other AI assistants you would start from a blank page which I absolutely hate you should never start from a blank page ever again that is my trick you'd have to look through all your old notes you'd have to find a template and at Amazon we would write six page papers for everything and I would have to track it down and see what what works what doesn't and it was a perfectly process it just took a lot of manual work and then You' show it to people manually incorporate their feedback and now with AI we have a GPT that has that existing doc template we can literally send in tons and tons of contacts right Gemini 1.5 Pro can take in a million tokens so you're able to send in tons of notes something really messy and get it to go through this process create the first draft of the memo you can then edit it we also have a GPT just for grammar edits right so subtask and splitting that out and then another GPT for Gap analysis so things like what's missing what else should I be adding and then if you share it with people to get feedback you can literally take that feedback put it into the GPT and say what edits would you suggest so this is again we're talking about workflows here another example is summary of customer insights again my days at IBM my days at Amazon it always pretty much look like this you'd create some sort of sim ticket to pray and beg for a data analyst who would then go into whatever database you're using or maybe some Salesforce data they would create a powerbi or Tableau dashboard you'd have to wait a while the dashboard maybe wouldn't be spoton you'd have to then see the draft it would take a week and again that is a perfectly fine process the eventual dashboard would be good your insights would be good it would only take a week right this is way better than what it was 25 years ago with AI now what that is looking like is if you take a if you start with a spreadsheet like I was saying with Google Sheets you can send it into code interpreter to get those automated insights or data visualization um my two Second Story here it's not customer insights but I hosted a blind dumpling taste test party and everyone had these score sheets for every single dumpling that they tested from every single place and I just wanted to be able to send like a recap of what was the best dumpling whatever I just sent in all the raw data into code interpreter obviously there's no pii because we're talking about dumpling scores so who cares and then I autogenerated the email that came out of that and then I edited to make it you know funny and in the alley voice but these are again efficiency gains that I just don't want to be an expert on Excel formulas and so I'm still bringing in my creativity I'm still bringing in my critical thinking but I'm offloading the piece that is manual that is repetitive that I don't want to be an expert in two more examples one is a thing you cannot easily Google and this is really about bringing together sources and then consolidating those sources it's things that when I was growing up we had to go into the library find the encyclopedias find the books on these topics read the page right flip through a 400 page book to find it Google certainly changed that from days to hours or minutes and so maybe it's asking a question like what generative AI features does zenes have right and unless zenes has written a blog post exactly describing that you're GNA have to read a bunch of sources or maybe it's who are the top 10 AI experts in Houston or what are the best things to do in New York under $100 that have to do with flowers okay it's things that a blog post does not perfectly exist so before AI before all these AI assistants and again AI has been around for decades but I'm using chat gbt as the demarcation Point you'd have to Google this topic you'd have to you know search something like Apple news to then consolidate yourself or search Quantum Computing to figure out things yourself you'd have to read all these top links you would have to do the synthesis and now you can ask the question in the total natural query way okay and so this is a new skill set that folks are building instead of asking you know New York best things to do right you can just say best things to do under $100 with these um certain prameters and so again you might not totally be saving 10x or you know 90% of the time but your results are going to be much better and much more Consolidated across multiple sources maybe it's not two articles that you'd read manually it's 20 articles that was able to scan last example and then I'll I'll give you a framework that's really helped me in some some more ideas is testing a new product course idea and with web and social so this is combining Web Design This is social media creation pre Chad gbt you would write an ad copy from scratch write social media copy from scratch a designer would craft this you know new website from scratch and we did this by the way when we were launching new courses like what should be the messaging and how should we go about this again the process was fine but it would take about a week to start to get some of these drafts together and so I don't know if folks took my free 5day AI email course but that was a brand new landing page brand new social brand new everything and so how did we do that we had a brand voice gbt that has a ton of alley posts right so it took a ton of effort I've been writing online for seven eight years so we give it the Ali brand voice we literally host a live brainstorm with my entire team plus AI live back and forth so like bringing in AI literally as a teammate into these brainstorms my designer is in the meeting this is not after the fact in the meeting on screen share drafting a web page using tools like wizard you isard um there are a bunch of tools like you know figma we use both literally in the meeting sharing this live page getting feedback right then and there then we're sending to gpt's to again regenerate drafts in Social posts we're still manually editing and so in that exact one hour maybe two hour live meeting instead of just getting the strategy out we are getting drafts of everything out so those are some ways that we are actually using AI in our business every single day and I want to give you guys my craft framework this is um what I give to my clients and I think the big thing here is that a lot of AI guides or a lot of Instagram posts including the ones that I post by the way will be really Niche or narrow use cases like the four that I just gave and it's a lot um it's a lot easier to make that content but it can also feel really overwhelming as a listener a viewer reader to say like okay I I totally understand how it looks like in webpage development how do I extrapolate that to everything else that I have to deal with in my life right if I'm talking to my kid how do I use AI if I'm in a stressful negotiation with my boss how do I use AI it's harder to extrapolate so I want to give you my framework for that extrapolation and it is the craft framework because it always has to spell something right okay there's going to be overlap between these but this is at least how my my brain works the C is Clarity the r is robustness AI uh a is action it's so sad that every single time I say a I just defaulted saying AI f is four thought T is 10x so in the world of clarity this is going to be about asking questions summarization it's about distilling transforming managing crazy disorganized crap and turning it into something useful so taking you know 1,500 articles and summarizing the top three key points taking 10,000 product descriptions and synthesizing the tone of voice right it's that distillation and one example that we literally did for our AI first mission statement was ask me this is me prompting chbt ask me 20 questions to craft this mission statement right so it's giving me Clarity in the process I'm still doing the work I'm still doing the heavy lifting I'm still doing the editing but is providing Clarity R is thinking about additional layers of thought again AI is not perfect AI is not going to capture every single thing on your mind this is adding an additional layer it's taking it from you know a B minus that you would have done in an hour to maybe an A minus but it's that Delta that you should be thinking about not the eventual Peak that you hit so one example again I'll give an example um Deep dive is Gap analysis compliance checks thinking about how this matches up with other data so I always I don't know visually I just go like what is the one more step what's the one more consideration we should be thinking of action I'm obsessed with this one if you've seen any of my tips I love love love this it would be something like turning a general thought into an action plan so you can ask Chad gbt or ask any of these um AI assistant and all these AI systems by the way have different pros and cons so again chat gbt is great for some things not for everything but maybe I'll say hey I'm thinking about buying a house in Manhattan in the next six months create an entire action plan for me with Milestones that I should be hitting kpis that I should be hitting questions that I should be asking myself weekly journaling whatever but taking something that you've been wanting to do it's a very goal oriented outcome one of my predictions for the future of AI is that things are moving toward a goal oriented approach so give it your goal say I want to have a better relationship with my kids and here is our you know current state or here's what we're about to do we're about to go on this vacation to Paris what should we be doing so turning that into an action plan right helping it um convert that into numbers or decisions um again you decide whether you can trust it maybe you ask it for five options and you pick option three it doesn't matter but this is a really helpful one four thought thinking about Downstream implications this is more like a domino effect um whereas robustness is kind of that one more layer and 10x I just go nuts with this I I can Bank on that context length uh the cost of context links plummeting so right now we have 1 million tokens literally a year ago we had 8,000 okay we're going to be getting to a billion Conta a billion token context length and I believe that the cost is going to drop by 10x 100x so knowing that it's better to plan now for using AI is this ten-fold increase so if we as a team are brainstorming titles for a new course including this course by the way we might give it hey here's our 20 ideas come up with five more or here's our 20 ideas come up with a hundred more more here's our uh guide of how we're creating ideas come up with 10 right give it the seed give it the the anchoring and Let It Go freaking nuts but we literally invite AI as a teammate into these brainstorms and it has changed how we do our business okay so this is the craft framework screenshot it screenshot it screenshot it I'm now going to show you what I would have loved to have shown you in video form but these are going to be screenshots okay and and by the way I should say I feel very odd and vulnerable sharing like exactly how I prompt and exactly I'm going to literally show you like meeting notes um from in internal meetings that we had um so this is this is a moment for me even though I know that I'm just on display for thousands of you okay Deep dive example one I'm just going to start with that c that's Clarity and I uh I I've showed this framework before um but I will like give little bits of information I don't do a prompt that's like one huge paragraph I break it out into categories that help me also stay focused so I tend to start it off with some sort of identity or some role for the AI to play so you are a Visionary yet pragmatic and tactical CEO you can prompt it with anything here you are a world-renowned Chef in batswana you are a 20time Olympic Athlete doesn't really matter um that is the identity assignment you can make this really long you can make short okay then I give it a task I add a hero task this is the main you know one big sentence what is the one big thing that AI needs to to do for me um so you're going to help me write an AI first mission statement for my company um this by the way I did last night the uh this is not the actual prompt that I gave it but it's pretty darn close then I break it out into subtasks so again I had that hero task and AI does really really well with like Tink Tink Tink Tink Tink think of it as a smart intern that you have to give it that step-by-step guide there are papers that show that this Chain of Thought reasoning literally helps an AI perform better telling an AI to think step by step telling an AI to take a break and uh take a deep breath and think step by step all of those improve the performance and so I give it those subtasks that I want to do so your task to ask me with questions read the examples and guidance below internalize this like what is even internalize mean right that's a little anthropomorphic I don't love it um but again test things out in prompt see what works see what doesn't then consider the most important questions I gave it a goal right I said to get the most diverse information my business and the future I set parameters please ask at least 10 questions I gave my action I will answer them then and only then should you provide 20 options for my mission statement okay so I break it down I provide it context maybe it's about what your goals are maybe it's about who you are maybe it's about the the state of the project that you're working on maybe it's about a disagreement that your team just had right so give it context on the situation and then I give examples sometimes I give guidance but it's usually examples um this I literally just pulled from online I tend to be pulling from my previous posts or I pull from like a transcript that I record but I feed it all of this and by the way this guidance and examples is like 5,000 tokens long this is a very very long thing I just couldn't grab it all on the slide okay so I throw it all in then Chad GPT asks me all these questions back what's your core differentiator who are your targeting what's your vision I answer all these questions we're an AI student Studio we want to help a billion people here's our tone of voice here's the thing we're most worried about chat BT then gives me honestly pretty crap answers it's boring it's generic I don't like it I then use that chat function to review to edit to update and I'm like this writing is generic right leverage this tone of voice from my mission for the mission statement here's an example of a newsletter I wrote if you guys are on my newsletter this is a newsletter that I sent out this week okay so I added in you know my tone of voice and then it gives me back improved ones right but I go back and forth okay so that is Clarity using AI as a means of gaining Clarity on a thing that you are stuck on we are going to go over 12:30 so if you have a meeting that you got to tell them that you're a little bit late for do that now this is worth it I promise Deep dive example number two is robustness okay as I mentioned we record every single internal meeting I'm about to show you actual recap from one of our internal meetings literally planning for this webinar this is the most meta presentation I think I've ever given so this is screenshots from otter AI on uh the far left right but we are using these tools to generate outlines on the left to generate transcripts by Speaker that's in the middle to generate action items that's on the far right these will have pii and private information in them so you want to be thinking through that as a team and that is what we use this for then here's where the robustness comes in we don't just have this output right super helpful to have an action item you can we have a gbt that like automatically generates an email followup to a client with action items so that right after the meeting they have that in their inbox and they don't have that 24-hour delay but we do one big thing after every big plan meeting and that is these four questions so either you can ask it inside of otter AI or any of these things or you can copy the transcript and ask it to chat you with te or gemini or cloud or any of these things but again please please please consider data privacy terms of service all of that here are the four questions that we ask every single time are there any legal considerations we haven't taken into account Financial considerations product considerations and user considerations and because all of these AI systems love to Yap I would say answer this concisely so we ask these four questions and again these are not for quick 10-minute strategy sessions these are when we're chatting for an hour on some big thing it is worth asking one question to AI to make it's a it's not even measure twice cut once it's measure seven billion data points cut once okay so we take this extra beat to get that layer robustness to consider privacy laws to consider target audience demographics to consider how are we going to gather feedback so that we can continuously improve the product maybe we hadn't considered a feedback mechanism okay so this is our robustness and again using AI to keep that in motion literally bringing AI in as a teammate to help answer these questions in addition to this we have a GPT that not only asks these four questions and answers them but also gives mitigation strategies for the top ones that we select so obviously you know it's helpful to get mitigation strategies this it just ends up being too long so we'll go back and forth with it okay those are the Deep dive examples I now want to give to you my school of AI productivity and this is I don't have a good analogy other than like I need you guys to think about how you're going to graduate up this this ladder this staircase and here is the layout these are five steps you're going to figure out where you are in this five and we're going to figure out how to get you to the next step here we go I'm rambling number one is just start if you're joining this webinar because you're my like aunt or cousin or high school friend or something and you haven't yet used AI just open up one of these websites go to cloud. go to chat. a.com and just test one of these I say it starts with kind of crappy prompting okay this is what we saw when chat first came out write me a Blog about Ai and it would just be some you know multi-paragraph it uses the word d 12 100 times right or you'd edit back and forth and say make it more friendly and then it would use a hundred different emojis right just start it could be on line just start to get a sense of what these systems can do number two once you graduated from that you are going to go from kind of crappy prompting into Super Mega awesome prompting you are going to do things like what I just showed breaking down tasks breaking down subtasks providing your goals providing the target audience I even provides success metrics like kpis things like you will know you're successful if and then I'll write that out this might change based on platform Claude this is still coming out on Twitter but like Claude supposedly is better at XML um Chad gbt is better it's kind of this sort of layout and markdown so you have to think about what platform is best best for which task I really like Claude for mimicking my voice I really like you know chadv other things so that is the Improvement stage once you have decided I'm a prompting expert I love the output that it gives me I only have to go back and forth you know one time okay the next graduation step is to streamline it this is I I cannot stand when people write the exact same prompt from scratch so you're going to create an sop document right and maybe um someone on my team can drop in the SOP post that I uh shared yesterday on LinkedIn about writing my newsletters you can create gpts for repeated tasks again make sure that you're not uploading private information there you can create prompt repos for your team I've T chatted with people who have prompt repos for their families okay where every night if they're like making a fun game they'll have a prompt that they share Alisa and I literally had a chat gbt karaoke night with our friends that had a prompt that we re used so you can get a lot more efficiency out of this I use text Replacements on my iPhone for different prompts so that I can do it on the go and you can also be leveraging AI to write those new prompts so once you're like I am so streamlined I have gpts out the woo I have every subtask broken down I know this I want you to graduate to stacking these and to think of it as a workflow so in Chad GPT you can call gbts one by one one example that we use is summarize these doents great now combine it with a transcript and write a post on this then hold on yeah get me gets me so pumped I just I get so thirsty then add a hook to this that's a separate GPT then turn this post into a video script that's the sear TPT then create a social post for the script find that waterfall effect so that you can leverage each gain okay I think I'm going to hack up along guys I'm so excited last one then this is very early by the way but it is taking it into action mode and actually leveraging AI to do stuff okay agentive AI is still very very early there are a couple Tools in this space hyperight AI Lindy AI Adept AI I'm an investor in hyperight but I invested because I freaking love the product um so don't expect magic today but a lot of people are using these things to like make restaurant reservations I don't know if I I'm not a foodie but I know that these restaurant like lists will open up at 9 o'clock in the morning people are using AI to make that reservation right then and there okay so maybe next time you're buying Taylor Swift tickets think about that last step this is the school of AI productivity figure out where you are graduate to the next one a couple tips and then I'm assigning homework no one's getting out of this without homework okay number one AI is here to stay if you are running a business business this is not the time to be banning AI this is the time to think about adaptation of your workflows one of the best things that you can do and what I did when Chachi first came out I reviewed all the tasks that I was doing for I think I did a week and I literally just kept a posted on the side of my desk and was like wow I'm spending so much time writing emails I'm spending so much time you know outlining a a a memo so keep track of how you're spending your time AI productivity comes from that AI first mindset and self-awareness of how you spend your time today and I know I'm preaching to the choir here but usage drives learning so do things to make it easier bookmark it to your toolbar set it as your homepage give yourself a data set or you know spreadsheet that you can upload safely that's not leveraging pii sign up for newsletters that you're reading about these things these are some of my tips when to use AI if you're doing something two plus times just try AI if you think you could gain you know 30% productivity just try Ai and if you're blocked just try AI a lot of us Ai influencers and AI first folks literally have a Post-It on our monitor that says AI question mark so that you are again this is all about building a habit if you guys haven't read Atomic Habits by James clear it is a phenomenal book apply that to using AI here are your homework options I want you guys to throw it into the chat which one you're going to be jumping on this is accountability okay these are tactical step-by-step things that you guys can do so that you leave this webinar feeling so much more productive than you first came in here we go homework option one behind door number one we've got talk to chap GPT while doing something I literally have a minimum 10-minute conversation with chat TBT every morning it is the weirdest experience in the first couple days and now I'm used to it but it's the bottom right of the chat gbt mobile app you hit the headphones icon and it's a conversation back and forth you can select the voice it's kind of like the movie her but do it while your hands are doing something else maybe you're walking the dog maybe you're shopping you're you know making food you're doing your makeup whatever see what happens when you get into this habit ask it what to do with your day ask it out how to manage your task list all right that's homework option one and I want you guys to post these on social and tag me I'm excited to see what what you guys do option number two dictate to Otter AI while you're on a walk download the app dictate for minimum 10 minutes maximum an hour copy that transcript load into chat gbt and turn your to-do list into a toone list okay too hacky too hacky number
