all right so here are the goals for today's video potentially get the ti84 Bann from the acceptable calculators list on every standardized test probably give somebody a text to instruments a heart attack and help you pass your Calculus classes and how are we're going to accomplish these goals well obviously by creating a custom Hardware mod that connects the ti84 to the internet and let it bypass anti-cheating mechanisms it all starts with this port here have you ever wondered why your calculator has a headphone jack well it turns out it's not actually a headphone Jack it's the slightly smaller 2.5 mm Jack it's intended for transfer of like educational programs or other data between calculators and PCs but of course The Homebrew Community has reverse engineered the protocol and written software to connect to microcontroller instead I got interested in that a while back before I started this video and here's some of the fun stuff I did first I tried just turning on simple Electronics like LEDs which was not too bad next was turning on a homemade Rumble motor that I had left over from a previous project and lastly I made the world's worst N64 controller and what really cost my attention were the products that connect graphing calculators to the internet imagine if during a test you could just search the web chat with fellow students or even download cheat sheets you had prepared beforehand but you couldn't reasonably bring a setup like this into a test with you so here's the plan find a Wi-Fi enabled microcontroller cram it into a ti84 write some special software to get everything talking to the internet and by the end we should have a cheap undetectable ethically dubious internet enabled cheating device just in time for the school year ucation so first things first we need a microcontroller to me the obvious choice was the Seed Studio ESP 32 C3 look at the baby I've been using these little modules for a while and their tiny size and Wi-Fi connectivity are exactly what we're going to need one problem though it's a 3.3 volt system and the link Port uses 5 volts which would fry our microcontroller if we hooked it up directly the solution here is a circuit called a level shifter which converts digital signals from one voltage to another it's ones and zeros either way just the voltage that indicates one is different when I went to buy a level converter I skipped all the other level Converters on Amazon and bought this guy here that was apparently the wrong decision because the output of level converter looks like this it should look like this it turns out the much more advanced design of this level shifter is great for high-speed communication on something like a PCB with carefully controlled inductances and capacitances but not so great for a breadboard where wires are long and connections are less than ideal this dumbass bricks design with just a mosfet and a couple resistors is perfect for low speed less than ideal situations like the 9.6 kilobit protocol the link Port fellow YouTuber and Engineering God Keith saaks reminded me that these simple ones exist thanks to him for helping me not waste even more of my time even with the problem solved now I don't think I can just let this level shifter that wasted so much of my time get off scotf [Applause] [Music] free with that out of the way we can start assembling our modified calculator all the components fit conveniently in this little area of the calculator's back plate power will be provided via the battery terminals here and the pads for the link Port are conveniently Exposed on the PCB here so this came out less than perfect besides the fact that I'm apparently using the stiffest wire known to man the main issue is that I had to include this piece of Proto board here without getting too technical it turns out that the pull-up resistors for the level shifter were too weak and I had to include my own 1K resistors to stop random bits from erroneously being detected it also doesn't help that my soldering is less than ideal leading some pretty bad connections that impact the reliability of this mod if we want to go with the handwired approach so we're finally going to cross something off my channel bucket list build a custom PCB this will be my first real PCB that isn't just a simple breakout board but thankfully it'll be pretty simple all we need is a pad to slauter the microcontroller to some mosfets and some holes for some through hole resistors and connections to the rest of the calculator I also figured at this point that the mod deserved a name and given the microcontroller we're using and the device we modding ti32 felt fairly appropri yet but before we send this design off to a manufacturer I laser cut the outline of the board from some plywood since I don't want this video to take an entire extra week just because I can't [Music] measure So I placed my order and about a week later we have the first PCB of the channel well without any parts soldered to it the resistors I'm using are just through hole resistors which are simple enough to solder by hand but the mosfets are some of the smallest components I've ever dealt with so we're going to need my modified digital microscope and my hot plate I use a 3D printed bracket to mount the these lights higher up on the microscope so I could make room for the hot plate to sit under it that lets me work with hot pcbs and see what I'm doing at the same time what is important for service Mount components so all we need to do is apply a couple dabs of solder paste and place the mosfets don't worry about how my shaking hands maybe place the paste in Parts a little off center that'll fix itself once the hot plate warms up while we wait for that I'm going to take 5 Seconds of your time to quickly mention that I have a Discord and a patreon that I recently set up so if you're interested in seeing more of my projects or just harassing me links are down below thanks after after soldering the rest of the components we're ready to get this board programmed for the calculator I just wrote a program that lets you launch one of the many different applets from a menu each applet is written in TI basic and just handle stuff like drawing to the screen and getting user input but how do they actually communicate with the board well the microcontroller is set up to be impersonating another ti84 which means that our applets can just use the built-in send and get commands to send or receive variables from the microcontroller on the microcontroller there's a list of commands things like connect to internet get list of images or send chat message each with a unique ID to start one of these commands an applet simply needs to just set the C variable to the appropriate ID and send it Follow by any arguments to the command most of these commands make requests to a central server running either in the cloud or on a home computer that you expose the internet but because the commands may take a while to complete the calculator has to constantly pull the microcontroller to see if the operation is done it's the code equivalent of that annoying kid who's constantly asking are we there yet but it totally works finally the calculator again uses get to get the results from the microcontroller whether that's a picture a message whatever and displays that to the screen I glossed over the details but if you're anything like me and want to see those details check out the GitHub repo for this project and I think we can finally put this thing together and show its true potential as you can see there's no way to tell if this mod is installed just through visual inspection which will probably get you by most paranoid teachers once powered on you may be confused by the lack of a launcher program this is intentional as a pre-installed launcher would be easily Spott and teachers have methods to stop students from using programs like wiping the memory the calculator putting into test mode to get around this you first need to set the P variable to a password that you had previously set in the firmware and then send it manually then with the microcontroller unlocked you set C to the command ID for download launcher and then send it manually again when this command executes it'll transfer the launcher program to the calculator by emulating the silent link transfer functionality supported by the ti84 turns out that test mode doesn't disable the send or get commands and one of the easiest ways to get a calculator out of test mode is just to send something to it from another calculator so this download launch command actually does two things it lets you not have it pre-installed on your calculator and it also will break you out of test mode if your teacher decides to use it but with the launcher now installed we've got four different applets specifically designed for test taking now available to demo them I grabbed this SAT practice book from a local thrift store alongside a PS2 DDR pad and a broken ring light that just needed a simple rewiring we're not going to be using those last two items I just thought they were good finds and I was kind of excited about them now for this demo I have the server hosting all the static files running on my local PC exposed to the public internet using enro on my phone I have a Hotpot running to make sure this was a reliable setup I brought my calculator along with me on a quick drive to the local Arboretum it was able to stay pretty consistently connected to the internet during the drive with only a few little hiccups so it should definitely hold in a more controlled environment like a testing center speaking of testing let's look at some problems for simple ones like this I'd recommend using the chat GPT applet it's fairly fast to type the question in and chat GPT is actually reasonably good at answering algebra problems sure it'll occasionally get some questions wrong but basic definitions and common facts aren't a problem for it at all and it's way better than trying to navigate a web browser on a low resolution screen like this however more wordy problems like this would be an absolute nightmare to try to get into a text prompt how would you even begin to type in a graph like this to tackle these problems I've developed a few other tools first of which is the chat app if you have no clue how to solve a problem but you think a friend of yours might you can ask in the chat room now I wouldn't have a lot of confidence in friends who need a calculator specifically built for cheating to pass a test but if you can Vince one smart friend to help you out then you're golden need some motivation to help you get through a long test why not pull up your wfu in the image browser applet you can browse images with the left and right keys and select an image with a number key this would be a great place to put a visual cheat sheet or other reference photos but if we're talking cheat sheets we need to talk about the app browser this app does two things for one it'll let you download games and stuff to play after you're done with your test but because you can also store notes in the source code of programs it also functions as a cheat sheet downloader so just like with the launcher if it's teacher has you clear your memory before a test and you'll still be able to get back your cheat sheets by downloading them from the central server I'm sure some of you are going to wonder about this camera option here if you're interested in what that's all about subscribe and uh I'll be making a video on this in the future and I think that's everything you can find the GitHub repo patreon and Discord links down below I especially want to thank the folks who have subscribed to my patreon before this video even came out the support means a lot as somebody trying to work on bigger and more involved projects I'll be posting more stuff there soon as I'm heading down south to help prepare a pretty awesome machine this next week and as always thanks for watching and you should be seeing more from me in a month or two
