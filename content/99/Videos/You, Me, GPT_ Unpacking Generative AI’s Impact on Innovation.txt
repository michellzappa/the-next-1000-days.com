all right everyone welcome to today's webinar from uh from Lux research we're going to be talking about topic you might have been hearing a little bit about recently uh GP generative AI large language model cat GPT um and what it all means for Innovation so my name is Mike hman I'm a SCP research programming here at Lux and moderating today's session and presenting um uni gpg unpacking generative AI impact on Innovation will be our senior director Anthony skavo uh we'll have uh we'll be we will be taking questions throughout the webinar there's a Q&A box on your screen you can type those in at at any time we'll we'll spend some time taking questions at the end uh get to as many as we can but if uh your question doesn't get answered or you think of a great one afterwards uh feel free to email uh question at Lux research in.com and we will get back to you on those to uh so without any further delay let me uh hand things over to Anthony to begin the presentation thanks Mike and thanks everyone for joining me today I want to start by taking it way back this is a set of Napier's bones this is a device from the 1500s uh that uses logarithms to take very complex multiplication division problems and turn them into addition and subtraction problems which could then be solved with this set of tables this device allowed the complex calculations of star charts and really played a pivotal role unlocking a new era of navigation that created the you know interc uh Exploration with all the positive and negative impacts of that age of exploration and I think a lot of people are asking you know is AI kind of like a new set of nap's Bones is it a new tool that is going to unlock a new age of exploration and Discovery with positive and potentially some negative consequences so that's what I want to dig into I want to spend a pretty good amount of time just talking about what AI is and how it works I think that's very important because there's so much hype and uh you know maybe misinformation or misunderstanding out there in the world then we're going to dig into ai's impact on Innovation specifically um and last leave with a few quick scenarios and implications uh for you and in your role as an innovator so what is AI is it a set of math models is it a tool for automation or is it a source of new knowledge right well AIS are probabilistic tools you know G pt2 here it uses um next word probabilities to build sentences and there's a degree of Randomness baked into it which you can see in the the temperature chart here that way when you put in the same PRT it doesn't always pick the next word that Randomness compounds and that's how you get uh these different outputs gp4 or chat GPT is a lot more complex than this but it works on similar principles and these principles of probabilistic estimation really underly almost every type of AI the way they work is with a neural net which is really just a visualization of a complex math problem each neuron represents a function that takes inputs and produces outputs those inputs are then multiplied by a weight and added to a constant and sent to other math functions you can use these to estimate complex functions uh like this complex function on the right you can estimate it with the complex neural net and what's important here is that you don't need to know anything about the function itself you can estimate it just based on the output data the way you do this is by training the neural net if you want to recreate a function you can give it examples and then adjust those weights uh constants and potentially even the the functions themselves within the net to produce better and better results this training is really at the core of what makes AI work whether you're replicating this pretty simple function here or you're replicating a much more complex function like for example predicting which word comes next in a sequence you need a lot of data to make this work though you can see that with 10 million examples our estimation is pretty good but with a million examples it's it still leaves a lot to be desired so all in AIS are probably bistic tools train on large amounts of data that can replicate the outputs of complex tasks and this is true for very simple neural net based systems and large language models which are basically the biggest neuron Nets that it's currently possible to make uh where you have billions of parameters and you're trained on trillions of data points in this context an AI company is the physical hardware needed to do this training and operation it's the data right it's the actual models themselves the nodes the weights the constants and it's also the human labor and knowhow and different companies have different elements of of all of these where some companies are really focusing just on physical Hardware you know in Nvidia right they're an AI company in that context some companies are just working on the data um and then at some point theoretically underlying all of this you'll have ai products but I'd argue we're we're still at pretty early stages of that but AI is not just a set of math models it's also a tool that mediates human labor right it changes the way we do knowledge tasks by automating fragmenting deskilling and Casual that work if you think about the assembly line that took manual labor from a very Craftsman bespoke process to something that anyone could learn to do in a few weeks the gig economy services like uber to something like being a cab driver and they automated and simplified deskilled a lot of those elements right hailing the taxy finding your way around all the elements of payment all of that was automated and so AI is really the next Frontier of that it's going to bring this automation fragmentation deskilling and casualization to knowledge labor roles whether that's marketing development or R&D or potentially you know Tech scouting but AI is also the product of a huge amount of Labor right um training the data tagging data managing this uh making sure the outputs aren't uh hostile toxic racist all of this requires a huge amount of human labor and it is primarily being used today exploited labor right um open AI has used Kenyan workers uh there's a ton of prison labor that's been used there's been you digital sweat shops opened in the Philippines um so AI is very much a way of transforming that labor into a sort of a capital cost right a a finished model that can then be used repeatedly but I would also argue that AI is a source of new knowledge right Ai and this is really crucial you don't need need to understand the problem or the function in order to make a working AI model of it right whether that's a material system you don't need to necessarily perfectly understand the theory of the property structure relationships or something like a uh you know human speech we don't have a a perfect theory of of human speech right um but we're able to make these models that can predict outcomes successfully this goes back as far as 2016 um some of the the earliest work done in the material space um on half husler compounds the point I would make is that you know I spoke to the CTO of cabat in 2019 and she said that when companies started to use materials informatics they're often resistant but instead of actually producing materials that they didn't understand what happened was the AI systems would make predictions the scientists wouldn't fully understand them and then they would go and Chase down a theory of knowledge right that's what scientists do so in practice the use of AI tools actually accelerated their understanding of material systems so when we think about AI as a set of mathematical models a tool for automation a source of new knowledge it's really all of these things and we need to keep that all in mind as we think about AI in the uh The Innovation ecosystem okay I've uh thrown a lot at you already but I'm G to keep throwing more stuff at you so you know let's just buckle up and uh let's focus on ai's impact on Innovation here right this is a very simplified Innovation funnel starting with the inside stage basic R&D Trend identification the top of the funnel working our way through ideation and brainstorming future State forecasting technical modeling innovator mapping pilot formation uh partnership formation and then down into the optimization and marketing when you're really having launched and are scaling up and Innovation there's a role for AI to play in all of these R&D can benefit a lot from creativity and from the automation of knowledge work this is a great example from Omar yagi which is a who's a leading professor in the metal organic framework space they used open AI tools chat GPT to both help phds write code even though they didn't have any coding experience and then also to basically read filter um a large number of academic journals pull out the synthesis instructions um of the metal organic Frameworks and then build a database with those synthesis instructions presented in a sort of a tabulated step-by-step form so I'd emphasize here that this combination of AI assisted workflow it really does require a plan and a structured uh approach and the AI is very useful in specific tasks like processing a large amount of information or uh you know providing code examples or creating code but it's not you know useful for every single uh sort of task within this and again having a specific workflow is really important you can't just ask chat GPT to to tell you how to make a metal organic framework uh a similar example is actually some of the work that lux's motive AI uses we use uh GPT as an interpretation layer um essentially feeding a large amount of contextual data everything from social media to news articles um a wide range of other sources and asking uh GPT to apply pretty established anthropological methodologies to interpret that body of text what I'd emphasize again here is that we're taking a very established methodology the anthropology at work is in some ways not that unique what's really unique is the scale at the scope of the data that we can process by training the open AI tool to do our specific methodology moving down the Innovation uh you know framework into more of a validation uh layer or validation step large language models you know they can really help uh produce Technical and financial models but again having a structured methodology really really helps here you can ask generic questions like hey Chach I need to make a model of a fermentation and if you do that you're going to get some pretty generic responses back out but if you go in with a specific structured question if you go in asking for you know specific structured outputs such as code and if you are referencing established approaches established models uh established techniques you can get much more uh better results and you can get much faster results especially for uh Innovation professionals who maybe don't have the skill set in coding or don't have the skill set in uh these analytical Frameworks it can be really valuable to um leverage chat GPT um in particular to or any large language model I should say to move towards these types of uh sort of Advanced Techniques for modeling or data processing and in addition you know large language models can write code that can interface with physical systems right so in this uh paper here um that I'm referencing on the right you can see that they used chat GPT to improve additive manufacturing what they did is they gave it examples of G-Code which is the machine code that controls a 3D printer and they actually said okay at this code tell us what's wrong with it compare it to some working code examples and then modify the code in order to make it better and you can see that chat GPT was able to do that um they then asked chat GPT to actually produce code from scratch to you know produce functioning working parts and it was able to do that as well what's important I think to recognize here is that these large language models really represent generalized knowledge models the ability to produce meaningful text whether that's human language text or structured code means that these models can produce and reproduce human knowledge so they represent a very generalizable kind of uh tool that can tackle a very wide range of different knowledge Tas asks because there's so much information and so much power baked into the just the structures of either human language or code in addition code is really the interface between the human and Machine World and that ability to produce code allows these tools to be very powerful and to have a really an immediate and direct impact here but again a structured approach is really important you know giving the uh uh the large language model existing code examples asking it to improve them um that's going to be a lot better and produce much better results in initial term than just trying to do something from scratch from the start so across all these examples you can see that structured methodologies are really important for interacting with large language models large language models have the opportunity to really accelerate the capabilities of a lot of innovation tasks and uh large language models represent a kind of generalizable knowledge model that's that's quite flexible as a result we're beginning to see a pretty wide range of companies proliferating to bring AI into Innovation and here I'm really looking at more recent uh recently founded companies you know companies using specifically large language models there's a whole range of companies using machine learning approaches other AI tools you know companies like citran informatics have been trying to do AI and successfully bringing AI to Innovation for years already so in a uh in a sense this isn't anything new what's really interesting and exciting is the proliferation of this sort of large language model based platforms that are very specifically targeted at different tasks within the Innovation funnel so you can see there's data management platforms um there's scouting uh approaches where they're using large language models to scrape and build profiles of uh you know companies and identify companies on the internet uh for the purposes of of being unbiased I have not included the logo of Lux Research Incorporated on any of these slides uh but of course you know we are very active I already showed one of our examples and there's a lot more stuff we're working on in house along these lines and there's even you know uh some of these Venture firms where they have a uh AI analyst who is making recommendations about um which company they should invest in so there's a lot of stuff happening but I think it's worth asking a question where will this stuff actually stick where will it be adopted and where is it going to create value you know you can use an AI tool to do a lot of different things but clearly there's a lot of hype in the market right now people are trying a lot of stuff they're throwing a lot of stuff at the wall where is it going to create value so there's two two Frameworks want to introduce but first I want to think about adoption where is it going to be adopted and I think about this in in terms of immediate cost savings is the AI going to be immediately cost-saving or immediately cost increasing and then is it going to be immediately performance increasing or immediately performance reducing is it going to be good uh right out the box or is it going to struggle now my team and I have mapped a ton of different applications on this framework there's a couple I want to call out one is information extraction right this is almost immediately going to be a cost-saving and performance increasing application of AI because it's quite straightforward to train AIS to summarize to digest to pull out specific uh elements of large amounts of data whether that's academic paper is patents uh you name it so there's clearly a lot of opportunity within this information extraction both to save costs compared to hiring someone to to read papers and both to rapidly increase the numberers that you can really sort through and scan and identify something like basic R&D though is actually cost increasing um and that may seem a little counterintuitive but the reality is if you want to build AI systems uh to actually assist in the core tasks of R&D that requires a lot of investment upfront uh you need to invest in data digitization you need to invest in in possibly some you know data Hardware uh to actually store and keep that data proprietary um you need to probably hire people to build either build custom systems or hire a third party to actually help you implement um you know this AI in your R&D process so it's definitely performance increasing we see a lot of potential benefits of using R&D using AI in R&D and certainly groups like citrine um have developed a very strong value proposition there but it's definitely something that represents an additional cost just for now and you know no small part of the reason of that is that it's difficult to uh or I would not recommend you know firing people reducing headcount right because that's really where the cost savings come from um so since it's not really possible to do that in the R&D space just yet um it really represents a cost increase in addition to a performance increase something like marketing or brainstorming I think is actually in that performance reducing uh sector uh same thing with partnership formation yeah it's possible to you know use an AI to go out and pitch startups on Partnerships but those are really tasks that require a human element whether that's a human- to human connection or you know a human's insight about the future of uh you know different Trends and a human's understanding of what really important and what what you know the context so these types of things are still I think a pretty long way away from being really meaningful but that doesn't mean people are going to do them especially in something like marketing you can definitely save costs by reducing headcount and use an AI to produce your marketing materials it might be much worse but you can do it but none of this says anything about value right we've been talking a lot about Automation and I've mentioned you know okay we can automate uh labor and we can save cost that way um but you know productivity growth has been very consistent through the digital Revolution automation has consistently increased uh you know our our productivity maybe 2% a year in the global economy but a lot of the labor that we're automating is not productive right it's things like marketing um where it's not directly serving products to to clients and so there's not a huge amount of value to necessarily be gained by automating that labor I would propose an additional or a different type of value which is the knowledge value right um you know going back to our early example of neuron Nets these can replicate the test data but they can also produce very different results outside of the test data and this ability for neural Nets to expand on the taining data means that they can be used to make predictions and those predictions can expand or challenge human understanding this ability to accelerate human understanding is really potentially very valuable in specific applications and so we can map again um our knowledge value here on this vertical axis against our automation value there are some applications like human Diagnostics where it's really valuable to do both right there's a really significant automation value in you know automating cancer diagnostics for example because that requ requires really really skilled really really expensive labor and you could potentially bring that type of diagnostic capability to developing economies or much more broadly if you can automate it but there's also knowledge value if you can develop an AI system that very accurately uh predicts you know cancer at a very early stage I don't think scientists are just going to leave that be even if the the AI system itself remains a black box that capability is definitely going to lead us to Greater understanding of you know cancer precursors right uh any type of disease diagnostic so the capability of the AI system is going to actually dve human knowledge and that's going to be really valuable in applications like Diagnostics like drug Discovery even in something like coding um but you know you look at R&D materials discovery this is uh know this core R&D is really going to be very impacted I think by um the Advent of AI because there is such a value attached to um the the theory of knowledge that you can that you can generate from it it's also possible even that you know some of the economics you know better economic models or better venturing models uh could could be accelerated by the use of AI so there's a lot of different opportunities uh to accelerate the the knowledge uh within the Innovation space and that's going to be quite valuable there's also opportunities for automation right um you know encoding model building um potentially startup scouting I think these are you know pretty medium but there's definitely some automation value to be had there the things that are are sort of at the lowest end of automation value knowledge value things like data management um where we don't necessarily need a new theory of of knowledge in order to really accelerate our our process there so you know to sort of sum up AI is going to be adopted where it's cheap and easy but the long-term impact is going to come from these high knowledge High labor roles where it's going to generate the most amount of value okay I want to Pivot and step back a little bit we've talked a lot about concrete tasks you know R&D data management development of synthesis routes everything from modeling to uh scouting I want to look at some of the the broader scenarios and the broader implications the big one that I really want to advance to you is that fundamental R&D has a big potential for impact the nature of the work itself could really be substantially disrupted right um I think we've been shifting from this very complex Theory driven R&D you know where your leading lights uh would generate a hypothesis test that hypothesis and that would be based on their their understanding of the world instead I think we're going to come at it backwards where we're going to test a huge amount of things and the goal will be to generate as much useful data as possible right um the task itself will be very simplified uh most of the work of R&D might might just be interfacing with automated systems whether that's an automated knowledge system like a AI or an automated physical system like a high throughput testing machine and then the role of the PHD will be to develop a theory based on the predictions and based on the real world testing of that Ai and to pick the direction for the R&D uh testing to move you know it'll be much more strategic and this will open up the labor pool to much you know less educated folks there'll be a lot more roles and opportunities potentially for a much rder range of different folks to to do R&D um and this could really change the the nature the construction of uh the labor force within the Innovation space companies are going to have to in the long term change how they staff right and then near term I think it'll be focused on more upscaling T you know staff building small task forces testing out some of these new methodologies but probably not you know my advice would be to not break the bank or to radically revise order charts but in the long term you know there is going to be a a much different structure in play um I think Outsourcing will be a lot more possible especially of these you know this data generation or these testing roles right um you know you'll still need experts and theorists but like I said that is going to be tied a lot more to R&D management long-term strategy than it will be to having the best theorists or the best fundamental chemists right um that role will occupy a smaller space in the workforce but I do want to leave some caveats as well I have a whole section on this and I could spend an hour talking about it but uh it's quite likely that AI can fail to improve right there's a ton of limitations on data availability model quality you know we can't just necessarily keep doubling compute every six months forever we can't keep doubling the data consumption you know uh every six months so there's a lot of ways in which you know the AIS themselves could fail to improve I think even the AI models we have today are going to be pretty impactful but you know a lot of folks say oh AGI is just around the quarter no it's not like we're we're still pretty far away from that um and I would also emphasize we don't really know what the cost benefit of AI is you know they're really really expensive hundreds of millions of dollars to train um and there's no business model that currently supports that cost you know companies like open AI are burning huge amounts of cash and the material basis needed to support large language models is really really tremendous it's a huge amount of energy huge amount of material chips water you name it right so we really have no idea what a profitable AI or a profitable large language model I mean there are profitable AI businesses I should say but there's no profitable large language model business so you know one thing that could happen I think is actually very likely is that these Services get worse over time or uh stagnate in terms of their performance because they are going to be tied to the uh the realities of actually turning a profit so I just want to leave you with a few key takeaways right AI it's going to change the labor force but um we are going to see some near-term impacts especially in product development especially in marketing but you know the real real impact in the long term is going to be R&D um I really think fundamental R&D the way we generate knowledge the way we we arrive at new theories of knowledge is going to be pretty radically uh changed but there will be impacts across Innovation everything from scouting to model building you know and I think the biggest risk today is from overreacting uh or acting with the expectation that AI will solve every problem and create a Utopia right um so people need to have a plan you need to have a posture you need to have a strategy but don't overcommit whether that's financial resources or changing your you know your headcount changing your work structure um this is going to take a lot of time to really mediate the Labor uh that we do in The Innovation space and you know really transform the the role of innovation and the structure of innovation so prepare for that but don't overcommit with that I want to just say thank you and we can open it up for a couple questions all right thanks Anthony and yeah a lot of food for thought and uh a lot of good questions about it as well um you if you talked about this this this changing R&D and and even Shifting the composition of the the the R&D Workforce right and making the analogy with the assembly line uh manufacturing techniques right assembly line manufacturing led to a huge increase in um in manufacturing productivity do you think this is going to lead over the next you know couple decades to a similarly huge increase in R&D productivity and the rate of innovation I definitely think it could I definitely think it could I think it will drive down the cost of a lot of um certain types of of of innovation you know stuff like formulation development you know custom uh yeah like customer Centric rantee in that way that should get a lot cheaper right and it should be a lot more feasible to custom materials for smaller and smaller applications right the the big question devel big big small sort of stuff right yeah yeah Big D small R stuff that will definitely get a lot more productive I feel quite confident in that the big question is if we can get a lot more productive in like inventing new materials whole classes right that you know type of productivity has actually been slowing down in a certain sense you know we have fewer and fewer big material breakthroughs you know we invented polymers maybe 100 years ago at this point in and um you we haven't had a huge breakthrough in material classes since then it's definitely possible though you could see you know everything from metal organic Frameworks to high entropy Alloys all these classes of materials that have been sort of theorized but um actually figuring them out has been really difficult like all that could be really radically accelerated by this but to me that's much more of an open question or a lot less certain yeah so you talked a bit about um you know the impacts of this and and for good and for ill what are some of the things I mean you mentioned like you don't think that like AI coming to you know kill everybody is and nearas humanity is something you're you're all that worried about I guess but what are the things that that do worry you as as sort of a downside risk from from AI so I'll answer this in two ways for companies the downside risk is that you overestimate the capacity of the capability of AI and you degrade the quality of your product and you end up losing a lot of institutional knowledge because you fire people right you say all right we're g to replace all of our marketing team with gu um and you fire all your your marketing team and the marketing is garbage right um it stinks everyone can recognize AI generating images this becomes a pretty simple thing and you know it just it reduces the value you know all that marketing that you do becomes totally valueless and meaningless and you sort of lose the capacity to to do marketing right um so for companies the the risk is very much to degrade the quality of your product right to degrade the quality of whatever it is you're doing um whether that's marketing or R&D Innovation for society I think the risks are uh there's a few one labor is a big risk right I mean yeah I think the reality is like if you go to a corporate uh person or CEO whoever and you say what if we um replace your marketing team with a group of you know prisoners in Kenya who are being exploited and and not being paid um they would say that's terrible we're not going to do that like we we're not going to do that on moral grounds right um but if you go to them and say uh we're going to use an AI to to do your marketing they're like wow yeah that sounds super exciting um even though those are the same thing in in a very very practical sense um you know the same structures are exactly in place the same material outcomes are happening for the people so one negative consequence of AI is that it allows companies to essentially conceal a significant amount of exploitation that otherwise would be unacceptable or unpalatable right so that's one negative consequence another one is um you know if you look at Uber right if you look at all the digital inovations blockchain Uber they're all essentially based on their ability to do crimes right like uh you know Uber operated illegally for a long time in many jurisdictions uh Bitcoin it's all about operating illegally right um you know in in in the context of Securities regulations and so in the context of patent or IP uh you know there's a lot of opportunity for AI you know there's this lawsuit right now with the new New York Times against open AI where you know they say you know it's demonstrated that that open AI can can reproduce whole segments of of New York Times articles right um so you know it's entirely possible that AI tools lead to a breakdown of you know or lead to a lot of criminality in terms of Ip law or in terms of uh you know fishing digital rights you know you name it there's a ton of ways that um you know these tools can just be exploited in that way and then the third thing I will just say is uh information misinformation right um already we're seeing the internet fill up with AI generated garbage right slop uh you can't trust it's you know Google results right uh you can't trust a lot of uh news you know I I've discovered all these Innovation news sites now that have popping up that are just purely AI generated so you know it can make the job of the innovator much harder to actually gather accurate information and I think personto person communication you know whether that's interviews or meetings conferences is going to be a lot more valuable in that context yeah you can't you can't trust that video of Dwayne The Rock Johnson offering you a Medicaid deal which is a real AI the L burning or whatever you know yeah all sorts of criminality and scams um maybe one last real quick question um you know you talked about this kind of from the perspective of an R&D organization like if you're an individual say say maybe especially early midcareer uh type of person working in in an R&D Innovation type role like what should you be doing to kind of prepare yourself for this for this future do you like go to MIT extension and take an AI course or do you start of start uh you know what what are the sort of things that you think about as preparing yourself I don't think taking an AI course is is a good idea I think the if AI improves over the next decade I think the way it will improve will be becoming a lot more usable right a lot easier to use and a lot you know easier to like eliminate hallucinations and stuff right it's going to become user friendly so I don't think like taking an AI course that teaches you how to use the crappy tools we have today is going to prepare you to use the powerful tools we have in 10 years right or the user friendly tools um I'm a lot more I think AI will improve that way and I think that's a lot more likely than it improving in a like um becoming 10 times more powerful you know type of way so I think the thing to do is is you know either go deep on science and become one of those phds right who um you know who can really interpret the results right build that type of organization or become really fluent I think and building workflows and leveraging AI um and and you know in that context I think it's more about the stuff outside the AI like how do I structure data how do I get access to it how do I uh interpret results from AI how do I leverage that into an actual person's workflow rather than like you know how do I interface with the AI directly all right well thanks uh Anthony for for all the insights and thanks to everybody out there for joining us today this is uh concludes the webinar we will send uh the slide presentation recording to all the attendees by email um after you leave the webinar you will get prompt to fill in a survey we really appreciate if you can just take a a quick moment to do that uh we really use that feedback to try to uh inform and improve uh future webinars and uh of course we've got some uh other great ones uh coming up so continue to uh check out the future of Aviation on February 8th or follow us on these these social channels to to keep up to date with with uh with all the other upcoming events y thanks again everybody and have a great rest of your day thank you
