yeah ladies and gentlemen please please take a seat in the last rows first of all welcome of you and to be honest I'm really impressed because only 30 minutes after we announced that some ultimate will come to visit us everything was booked until to the last seat so Sam welcome here at 2m it's an honor and a pleasure for us to have you here today I would like to welcome all of you the young students who want to learn how you can become the next entrepreneur the scientific staff professors guests Partners from industry friends of Tom great having you here um Sam if um if if you look at you as a person and your product jet GPT I think everybody knows that both of you are not just the Talk of the Town you're really at the talk of the globe and I think that make you becoming one of the Breakthrough Pioneers in 2023 and the product chat GPT I think changed so many things it's changed the content of our discussions that you discussed with friends and colleagues in Academia or in industry or in on the street or in in the private environment usually it does not take long time and that it comes to the discussion about your AI and I think captivity is only probably a very first step towards artificial general intelligence and I'm sure that we will hear something about that today so that the AI system or the AI systems become generally smarter than humans and this I think we all agree will change everything in our human civilization it will change how we run companies we will change how we do new businesses it will change probably the productivity of science it may make medicine becoming more effective and I'm sure and this is important for us as a university it will completely change the way how we educate how to teach the next generation of young people but on the other hand we have to a certain that humans are still sitting in the driver's seat and that's definitely also one of the topic of today we have to make sure that all those developments do not come for our highest price and this is the price of humanity it's the price of self-determination and only I think if we bring both together technological advantage and technological advance and combine that with ethical standards which we give us also as scientists in Academia as well as an industry then I think we can really utilize the potential of this the enormous potential of this technology so that those Technologies become indeed so to say a companion of humans a supporter of us a helper that's those systems at the very end augment our own capabilities and not and do not work as competitors there for them welcome again here I would like to thank a particular also the dod uh I would like to thank the tomb speaker series because as usual the film speakers here is really managed uh very well to bring another top speaker today to Munich I would like to thank our colleague Rana techno thank you in particular also for the exchange we will have in some minutes with with Sam and I'll head over to Steffi Steffi is the management director of the dld and she will give the welcome words to you as well so a choice thank you president Hoffman you're an amazing president of an amazing University with great students and a bright faculty so hello my dear friends hello hello data scientists who have used a data scientist some only a few of you is curious uh hello curious people from the worlds of tech of business Investments politics arts and media it's my great great pleasure to welcome you all here with our very special guest dear Sam Altman and his friends I probably don't need to tell you about the transformative power of artificial intelligence but as you can see I'm not the youngest person here in the room maybe the oldest one and I just want to let you know that I've seen quite a few disruption of Technologies in the last 30 years I've experienced them all because I'm curious and sometimes it's good to be to have a short recap now remember remember my dears some of you have been in kindergarten and or even not born the birth of the commercial internet in the early 1990s with the first internet browsers like Mosaic Mark and reasons Mosaic Netscape who have you remembers Netscape good old Netscape swallowed by the Internet Explorer or whoever you remember this unexpected very unexpected speed boat called Google which made the knowledge of our world all of a sudden available and also made search a gold mine I've seen the rise of social media and how it transformed the way we communicate and share information and there was a disruption of entire Industries like retail publishing and music and many more and most recently we got into so-called Frontier Technologies like blockchain who is a blockchain guy who is into Quantum computing [Music] the metaverse and Laser Fusion Sam laser Fusion here are some guys laser Fusion Marvel Fusion in all this AI has been on a constant and steady rise it has become better deeply and this is a very important personalized and much more powerful and now it's very very fundamental that we've seen over the last years what it's how it's very very important and fundamental what we've seen in the last years with GPT and church GPT please my dear friends he and his audience in this amazing audience um realize this is only the beginning it's not in the middle it's not in the end it's only the beginning the beginning of a transformative Revolution Mr Hoffman you already said it but I have to wrap it I have to repeat it because it's so important the beginning of a transformative Revolution and you my dear friends sitting here looking at me you part of it and you better be part of it everyone is asking now what does generative AI mean for us what does it mean for our future for businesses for education for science for our open Society for democracy and for values for our values we really have to ask ourselves are we holding the key to a Prospero prosperous and much brighter future much brighter future or have we opened Pandora's Box and Unleashed something uncontrollable question mark question mark the cats cat is out of the back and that's for sure and we won't be able to lure it back in whoever you love cats therefore therefore I really urge you to actively shape the new reality we are facing now in our days digitalization is like electricity we know it but now now it's a new world so let's dive together into the unknown let's dare to know and make it our mission to understand and work with the complex world of generative AI prompt and trained not only large language models prompt and train not only large language months but more importantly for yourself the left side train the left side of your own brain the left side of your ombre learn to ask intelligent questions train yourself to do this this is the most important thing to do it but don't forget to recognize the patterns of your personal intuition I think intuition is something very wonderful trust just trust yourself more than ever just trust yourself more than ever please believe me it's true so be optimistic and very courageous in making the AI transformation of our world happen the glasses half full not empty here I but clear-eyed critical please please please take personal action personal action you are the one who are the future Sam here you are here here you are with your wonderful team thanks for your team working with them was an amazing experience you are the role model in you're a role model in your humanistic in your humanistic drivenness in your humanistic drivenness to embrace our future I'm so very curious to learn from you and I'm proud to how co-hosts hear this great event it's great that you choose Munich as your stop in Germany for your world tour must be very exhausting now it isn't is the place to be when we talk about development of future AI driven Technologies and the building of new business around them Munich is the place to be thank you thank you for being here Sam and thank you of course to Pascal and Leopold where are you Pascal and Leopold from the and the rest of the amazing Doom speakers areas and to Ryan attacker Professor reinert hacker who alluded you to Munich and to my new friend Teresa Lopez Teresa from your open AI team where I met at your beautiful offices in San Francisco I really was impressed how nicely it's decorated it is it is it's not just this it's much better [Applause] so thank you thank you for listening and now I have the honor and the honor because he became a friend meanwhile Grana tackle Professor Anna tackle the floor is now yours [Applause] all right thanks everyone so Sam this morning you were in Berlin with the bonus counselor so what did you talk about it yeah I'm sorry for being late but I think it was important and really good uh we we talked about a lot of things we talked about how how what's happening what's gonna like where we think it's gonna go what's important for Germany the sort of whole stack of what it takes to be great at AI um how to get the right balance between all of the upsides that can come here and regulation that you know keeps us safe in the short in the long term and doesn't overly restrict Innovation um and what the role for Germany and Europe was and all of that so we have a lot of students here and the students use chat GPT and co-pilot quite a lot right are you are you doing that so for a lot of people starting out to code they they see that all these simple questions that we ask them can be easily answered by GPT so they might wonder well why do we need to call it still or do we still need to code I'll learn how to code you want to take that um sure yeah so I'm actually an AI researcher AI safety researcher at openai so a big part of my job is coding and a big part of that coding has actually been kind of taken over by copilot which doesn't mean I let it do my work but like as I code it will give me suggestions and a lot of them are great um but it definitely doesn't mean I don't need to know how to code I should stop learning how to code I think for a long time tools like copilot will enable us to do our work with more leverage and scale it up basically do more in the same amount of time with the same amount of people and yeah I think that will continue to be this way and coding is still quite important to learn I I have two thoughts on this one is there's a long history we get better tools and we just expect more from ourselves we just do more we don't do less we always do more uh and I think if you look all the way back from like punch cards to low level languages to high-level languages the fact that you can program a natural language now the fact that the computer can help you debug better uh it just means people are going to write more and better code and we will get we will all of us get like better quality of life um but I think there's so much latent demand for services like this that we have something that helps us do our tasks and we just do better jobs also uh I hope people continue to learn to code and learn to write even if you don't even if you can do it better in the tool assisted way I think the benefits of these things are like very deeply about learning how to think and it'll be a big mistake if people decide to stop teaching this in schools so we have been seeing these systems getting better and better and on an extremely fast pace so for example GPT 3.5 that most people are probably using through chatgpt gets for example some things wrong but then gbt4 gets actually most things right right so we within a few months of releasing the product we're already seeing a lot of progress so the resource is used for this progress are pre-training on a lot of data in the internet and predicting the next token and a lot of compute right so do you see the scaling trend of things improving to continue in the next few years or do you think we might asymptote soon um I think that's definitely a scaling Trend that will continue for some time one issue is there's limited amount of data on the internet and on the planet so for sure at some point we're going to hit some limits of not being able to scale up more similarly for compute we can't just like at some point we need too much energy too many gpus there's probably a bunch of low-hanging foods that we can still pick up on the way we can also extend to more modalities like use video use audio and we might be able to think or like train longer on difficult problems and spend less time on predicting for example for example advertisements or children books but yeah for sure at some point we will need some kind of Paradigm Shift here that sounds good I think that's exactly right okay so Johannes mentioned this aspect of multi-modality so what we're seeing right now is lgbt4 is multi-modal so it can take images as an input um but the multimodal model doesn't perform better than the text-based model so but but if I as a human I can also learn stuff from video for example right and can also get better at text-based tasks so do you see a future where these models learn from a lot of data sources like text audio video I feel confident that's going to work I think yeah that I'd be very surprised if that didn't work yeah I agree Okay so we've all seen Chachi PT say my knowledge is cut off in 2021 right when we ask questions sorry about that it's a little embarrassing that that's we're gonna fix that you're gonna fix that okay so it seems very difficult to fix because the model is so expensive to to train so so can you speak to that well I think a couple of things one is you can keep training these models forever you have to figure out how to do it in a way where it really does update and the other is I think people make a big mistake when they think of these models as a database you know if what you're using this for is like I needed to know everything that was in the news every day that is like a it will work sort of but it's like the world's most expensive slowest least accurate database what you really want here is what makes this special why it's worth spending all this money and effort is that it's a reasoning engine and we're training it to be a reasonable engine we're not training it to like memorize all current data and then we'll figure out some sort of retrieval-like approach to give it the ability to search the internet so that it can know you know who won the sports game tonight or what happened yesterday and I think that'll be a better approach but we will try to figure out a train continuously because that's important for other reasons so open source models have been getting really good in the past few years and Germany is actually really active in that so for example there's a clip model from open my eye there's an open clip model led by a German researcher then there is a stable diffusion that's actually also by people from the Munich Center of machine learning and the data set is by a German non-profit organization so what I'm curious is what do you think is the role of these open source models and then these closed models which are much more powerful right especially gpt4 I'm gonna go first um sure I think for sure open source models are catching up and I think that's great um I think yeah I think there's a lot of impactful work that can be done with open source models I do think that it's dangerous to just freely release the strongest models that we've ever trained to the world and open source them I think we as those models get stronger we need to be careful about what harm could occurs in the world and we need to make sure we very clearly understand those arms and how to mitigate them before just giving everybody access to them but I think in general it's it's great that like the smaller models are catching up and like a lot of useful tasks that are clearly not a huge risk to humanity cannot be done by these open source models yeah I think it's awesome that we're seeing such great vibrant open source work happening and you know I think there probably will be some capability threshold where we feel differently about it but for now this is really good I'm curious if we stay on the same like GPT two to three to four trajectory for five and six how many of you would like us to open source gpd6 the day we finish training it oh wow well we're not going to do that but that's interesting so do you see the gap of the open source to this big loss one is to close somewhat or to open up more uh I think what will happen is the frontier will will not be open sourced right away and that'll give us time to figure out what we need to mitigate what the safety issues are but the open source lag will not be that much and you know a few years later once we know kind of what the limits are and how to make it safe there'll be very good open source models but my sense is that lag time is probably something we are going to want more and more we'll be happier and happier to have that over time okay so a lot of the advances in AI have been coming out of private research Labs like open AI a lot of the bigger advances so we are the universities so you know why do you think these advances are really coming out of private research Labs not so much out of University and what can we do better um I think one big limitation of course is compute like it's much harder for a university to get access to this amount of compute for for example trading a model of the size of gpt4 which doesn't mean there's nothing else to be done like clearly smaller models are catching up we now have models that can run on one GPU that are catching up to GPD 3.5 behavior and I'm sure there's a lot of additional work that can be done to make things more efficient and more accessible also for smaller labs are like smaller amounts of compute um yeah I think yeah I think structures like open air good at some things universities are graded a lot of things and it's generally reasonably complementary I think there's a ton of work that's happened in universities that wouldn't have happened at somewhere like open app I think the things that open AI is good at sort of the culture we have the way we work wouldn't quite translate to a university Department but I think that's all really great like we we all get to benefit yeah so we benefit from each other to some extent yeah so to reach capabilities like of a bottle of like gbt4 it seems you have to get a lot of things right like the data the training like the engineering and all that and can you speak a little bit to yeah what are you doing right at open AIO what kind of decisions what structures lead to the ability to build something like that I mean we can like talk about a lot of little things that we try to get right and we do try to get all the details right this is I think something that open eye has a good a good focus on you know it's not always a it's not usually about the one big breakthrough idea sometimes those happen but it's about doing 200 little things all really well and everybody looking at the entire you know jointly optimizing across the entire stack so the people that work on the that like the networking for our big cluster are talking to the people doing the ml research and the people collecting the data sets and that's really important um but we sweat every detail everybody looks at trying to sort of optimize this one super hard thing we're doing so hundreds of people work together and they're all just trying to like make the gpt4 model be good um and then the other thing is a culture that is good at repeating Innovation and I think this is one of the harder things to build in any kind of institution business at the Academy whatever but people who are people who are focused on figuring out how we're going to do the next thing and the next thing and the next thing even if it's different each time and being relatively disciplined and sticking to our convictions so I think it's very easy to copy it is very like once openai makes gbt4 a lot of people are going to copy that um but the special thing about open AI is we will go figure out the next paradigm and that's that's I think what we're actually good at yeah I I agree it's a lot of attention to detail a lot of very hard work to like get every single piece of a huge engineering feed right we hold each other to pretty high standards and like do a lot of thorough work testing every single piece and in the end I basically get multiplied together so the better every part works or like making sure that every part works is really really crucial very interesting so there's a lot of discussion about what AI or how AI will impact jobs and I mean I can say it impacted my job very positively so using it in all sorts of aspects um so there's a lot of discussion on that so it seems that there are also risks associated with essentially not adopting AI in some jobs so what jobs do you see most affected by AI if they do not Embrace AI in the next like let's say two years in two years I I think people always overstate the amount of change that's likely to happen there's like a lot of inertia in the system um but if we look at like 10 years I would expect a great majority of jobs to be better off if they Embrace AI than not um but again I think this is it can it's like a Fool's errand to try to predict exactly how this is going to unfold like one thing I would say confidently is that the rate of change in the future is going to be much faster and people who use AI tools are going to be more productive more effective than people who don't but beyond that the ways it actually rolls out you know if you if you look at the Historical predictions about what AI was supposed to Impact versus what it's doing right now if you look back at what all the experts said five years ago they were like horribly wrong and we can sit up here and be horribly wrong again it's like sort of you know fun to speculate but I think you've just got to embrace the rate of change and and embrace the productivity gains from the tools so a lot of people watched the Congressional hearing last week where we went was a super interesting uh hearing as a European it was interesting that everybody agreed that we should regulate AI further however in Europe we have the toughest data regulation laws in the whole world already and we also see that that impacting us negatively so for example um Bart is not even rolled out in all of Europe right so this regulations tend to have positive impacts but also negative impacts so do you think especially in Europe or Germany that there's also some risk of kind of over regulation and stimulating you know I think regulation is I mean as we've been calling for it I think regulation is is really good um for a technology like this I I generally think it is better to wait and see what's going to happen and then regulate responsibly but there are times and I think this is one of them where you do want to be proactive you still have to get it right one of the reasons I'm doing this trip around the world uh the biggest one is to just listen to people particularly our developers but also all the people who are being impacted by this technology and asking what they'd like us to do how they want this to work or they want the limits to be how we should decide what the values of these systems are going to be and how much how we make sure that people can customize it by country by jurisdiction by Culture by individual um and just sort of like that's been it's been quite good to get out of this sort of like Bay Area Echo chamber I've been to a lot of other places so far but another part of this is to talk about the importance of Regulation and we think it's really important we we want to make sure that whatever is passed around the world is and like sensible and that we're able to comply with it but we certainly want to do that so you just mentioned while you use so there there are different values and there's also very different ideas on how people think what is biased what is not biased and it seems like something extremely difficult to balance if you just have like one system is there going to be a word where there's going to be different so I sort of don't believe that any two people on Earth will ever agree that a system is unbiased um and I think that's good I think that's fine at least I think we do have to Define what the outer bounds of a system are going to be you know what are the things that it just won't do and then also if you're using it in Germany versus using in the US there will be different laws and some things that it can do in one place and not another uh and then and then most of all I think giving users a lot of control within those bounds of what they're going to how they want the system to behave what their value system is is really important we've we've done our first little thing with that with the system message in gpt4 which I think gives people a taste about this could work um but I think we're going to have to figure out a new Democratic process to Define what the bounds of the systems are what the default is and then how much we let users customize within that what do you think yeah um I think ultimately we will need some system where there's some like you said some God well some framework around like what will never be allowed this might be something like not violating the chatter of Human Rights or something that we can generally agree on as Humanity of being bad and then probably a lot of the rest of the behavior should be decided not by us as a company or Not by a few like a small amount of people but by some process some democratic process maybe countries come together maybe there's some um like kind of governance around the world or maybe every country will decide for themselves like Germany has different law for freedom of speech than the US for example so there might be different Behavior around this in different countries we are trying to make our models both better at following certain guardrails that should never be overwritten not with jailbreaks not if you ask nicely not if you threaten it and we're also trying to make our models better at being customizable so without retraining one model for each person on the world making them listen more to additional instructions of what kind of behavior they user or the developer wants and trying to strike a balance in like resolving this hierarchy of values and like um still having great behavior in the end okay so I have a thousand more questions but I want to give the audience a lot of time to to ask some questions so before that just one last question so like we have a lot of students and young people here and people from Tech who are like super excited about the opportunities of AI and building careers around it building businesses around it um can you speak towards the opportunities that you see for them this this is the best time in at least 15 years and honestly probably longer than that to be starting a career in technology um like this this two or three year period that's about to happen should just be like a Cambrian explosion of new stuff I think um I think this this is going to be the most useful impactful beneficial amazing tool that Humanity has yet created I think I used to say the computer was that and then we didn't have anything that surpassed it for a while and I'm pretty confident this is going to surpass so everyone is going to do super great it's just going to be this like incredible up elevator for all of us but man if there is a time to like really go build something amazing at the beginning of a new platform shift uh this is at least the best moment since the iPhone App Store launched and probably back longer than that probably since the internet thank you so much so now let's hear from the users of me I so who has a question so we have two people with microphones
