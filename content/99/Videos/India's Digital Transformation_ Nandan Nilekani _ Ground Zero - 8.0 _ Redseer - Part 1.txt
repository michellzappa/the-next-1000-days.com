[Music] foreign his prolific profile keep it short yeah more than a day but um and the co-founder of chairman co-founder and chairman of Infosys a hazard an inspiring Journey he played a pivotal role in aadhar as its founding chairman leading the groundbreaking aadhar initiative that impacted billions of lives nilakani's contributions extend well beyond Infosys and aadhar he headed the government of India's technology committee and has been instrumental in shaping India's digital landscape to sum up three things which comes to my mind when I think of Nandan is technology and uh accepting my invite to come to the office would be great to hear your vision of digital India thanks Anil it's really a pleasure to be here I I was convinced to come to this office because they said if you go to the balcony I'll get a panoramic view of carbon Park so that was the bait he used to get me here so it's great to be here and uh so I'll basically talk about India's digital transformation uh I'm of course you guys do this day in and day out but I'll give it from the point of view of what is this macro changes that have happened in the last 15 years which has also enabled the Innovation and Entrepreneurship that you you are following now you know way back I mean you guys are too young for this but way back in 1991 India had a balance of payments crisis we had to send a goal to the bank of England and so on but today we have 600 billion dollars in the kitty and that's one of the reasons for our strength whereas many countries in the region are struggling or in 2011 we were the most unbanked only 20 percent of people had bank accounts in nine years or eight years eighty percent of the peoples now have bank accounts what would normally have taken 46 years took only nine years and this is something which which was a huge LeapFrog over the classical ways of doing uh development Now The crucial year was 2016 2016 many things happened in 2016 and sorry when we were in 2016 we didn't know what it was happening but it was happening uh because in 2016 we had on April 4 2016 the aadha project reached 1 billion people so one billion people had a we had begun the project in 2009 when I joined the government so but 2016 meter is 1 billion people so in seven years one billion people had an ID and so this happened on April 4th 2016. on April 11 2016 we launched UPI UPI was launched in the Taj raghuram Rajan at that time was the governor myself and PCI were all there and we launched up on April 11 exactly one week after aadha reached uh this thing and then on September 5th 2016 jio launched the mobile the new jio network and on November 8 2016 demonetization happened fundamentally this was a whole year when dramatic we didn't know in the middle of the year we didn't know all this is happening now what happened was obviously you know this very well that the price of data fell dramatically and data consumption went up dramatically and data consumption went up from half a gig a month to half a gig a day 30X increase in consumption smartphone prices collapsed we had six 700 million smartphones and then of course the whole demonetization gave a Philip to UPI payments in in may we launched in May of 2016 by October 2016 we had hundred thousand UPR transactions a month and today we have 9 billion so you can see that between the Tailwind of demonetization and the Tailwind of kovid you got a huge huge bump so this is the fact that we went from in six years from nothing to the world's largest digital payment system and it was built on top of all the infrastructure we have and that also laid the foundation for the vaccination program because with everybody having an aadhaar and a common architecture of Cohen you could go anywhere and get a vaccination and you could take the first vaccination in one location the second one somewhere else the booster somewhere else you got a digital certificate signed keep it on your phone keep it in the digital Locker the dramatic change that happened all because the infrastructure that we had so what what is happening what what we believe is happening is that India is making irreversible non-linear change there's not linear change of six percent growth is about suddenly something happening some kind of new paradigm of productivity which changes the rules of the game and each change is then acting as an input to the next it's all it's all building up together and we call this as combinatorial Innovation at population scale so each of these Technologies is enabled by a building block and this is what we call as digital public infrastructure so this is not about individual companies but creating a population scale infrastructure which is accessible to everyone low cost interoperable Etc and that's why this term is now called DPI or digital public infrastructure and it also is important because we needed a different kind of infrastructure in the west when when the internet became popular in the west and say after the year 2000 and the rise of Google Amazon Facebook and so on it was driven a lot by advertising Revenue because in the US they were spending a few hundred billion dollars on advertising on print advertising and television advertising and digital I was able to take that money away from television and print and take it to the digital world because the average spending in the US per head is 862 dollars you are all data and all you guys are big on this data stuff so it's whereas in India it's only seven dollars so fundamentally India could not have built a huge economy on Advertising hydrogen Revenue was was totally about 12 billion dollars over digital was two or three most of it going to Facebook Google and whoever had the IPL account so fundamentally it had to be done on a micro transaction basis which is why UPI became so strategic because to really have transactions on the internet at scale you needed a low cost high volume small value transaction system which is why UPI became important so essentially the Indian internet is not a advertising Lady Of course revenue is also going up but it's not an advertising LED Internet it's a transaction-led internet which I hope is confirmed with what you guys have found out but that's it is my view and these are built as different pieces of the puzzle identity payments and now we have something for data empowerment I'll come back to that and all of these are designed to be interoperable fast cheap and so on so it began with aadhar 12 digit number 1.3 billion people have it it's used 80 million times a day so 80 million transactions or authentications happen in a day all in real time anywhere in the country on the cloud and this allows you to say who you are John is John Ajit is Ajit Abdul is Abdul part is Pat whatever but the important thing about along with authentication we build something called kyc and the other kyc use the basic information we had in the database of name address date of birth and sex and created an electronic kyc where with the consent of the person you could do a kyc which could then be used for different purposes and we worked with all the Regulators Reserve Bank of India for banking trai for mobile phones and made aadhar kyc as the kyc acceptable to those Regulators so what it does is it lowered the cost of customer onboarding cost and time so earlier to take you know few hundred rupees and several days to sign up a customer now you could sign up a customer in two minutes using an aadhar kyc and this Foundation was laid in 2012-13 but it really took off uh you know later when it was used by in two ways again independently one it was used by the government to launch the jandan yoshna program and that opened 700 million new bank accounts in India which is why the bank penetration account penetration went up so much and it was possible because other kyc allowed you to rapidly open bank accounts and the same other kyc was used by jio to enroll one million customers a day because what Geo was trying to do was in a matter of six months they had a six month window in which they could give free connections and the idea of that was to give free connections was to test the network but they converted that into a customer acquisition opportunity and said we will get to 100 million customers in six months but the only way they could do that was doing an aadhar kyc because they could just do a kyc and give a SIM card in two minutes and so they built an architecture for doing one million kycs a day which is how they reached 100 million customers today their 430 million customers so they essentially lowered the cost and time of onboarding use a six month free period and ramped up to 100 million customers so it would become a strategic average so the important point is aadhar kyc is applicable for banks banking bank accounts Insurance buying insurance policies buying annuities pensions mobile phones Etc mutual funds everything and what this does is essentially lowers the cost of customer acquisition and reduces the barrier of Entry to newcomers to take on incumbents so in banking in obviously in Mobile it was jio which was the newcomer which took on incumbents that were there but anyone in Banks paytm Bank came and you know so many banks came they all use aadhar to rapidly get new customers so it's very important and then of course UPI took off dramatically uh the up architecture is very important UV architecture was to create a neutral payment payment Road or rail built by npci which is a non-profit company regulated by the RBI and owned by the Banks and the bank account was in is in the bank account so you don't touch the banking system but in front of this you can have multiple apps on which you can make your payments and that led to the rise of phone pay and Google pay and you know and paytm of course also came around so today we have uh nine billion transactions a month we have about 300 million people who use UPI and we have 50 million Merchants who accept QR codes for payments 50 million now to give a sense context of the scale in the first 75 years of Indian independence we only had 6 million point of sale machines which accepted cards and in three years you had 50 million Merchants who accepted QR code payments the scale was completely different and as you know today you can you can't pay in cash anymore they look at you as if you're weird or a foreigner because you know how do you pay this stuff right so that's nine billion transactions a month and it's everywhere today as we just talked about it you know guys on the street sell your stuff and all that the other important thing was also on the logistics side the development of fast tag which again was came out of a report I did in 2010 to build a passive RFID tag based system to pay toll and today that does about 2.4 billion transactions a year across all the highways and all a collection of money on highways now is done electronically they just debit your bank account or wallet and that has made a big difference on the logistics all these are all macro economic benefits and then of course digilocker which you know I'm sure I hope all of you use it is anybody here who doesn't have digilocker or they don't want to tell us that you don't have any Renegades who don't have digital Locker summary okay so anyway so you have DJ Locker you can keep your aadhar card driver's license passport covet certificate whatever you want show to the airport and so on So currently about 150 million people use digilocker 5.6 billion documents in it and there are multiple document issuers your high school certificate degree certificate Etc the whole idea is to create an introoperable secure documentation infrastructure and then the latest thing is the account aggregator system which allows people to get access to their own data in the financial system it the data comes from what are called as financial information providers Banks mutual funds Etc and I can ask my account aggregator to get my data from here and send it to an app that gives me credit or something and this is something which is applying to the whole financial system the reason why this is important is the only architecture in the world where you are in control of your data this is otherwise when data accumulates it's accumulated in you know by the companies or by governments here you are in charge of your own data you can access it in real time from any Source through an open API it is sent encrypted to these guys and you can give them consent as to what they can do with your data and this essentially democratizes many things and the one important thing it will demonstrate is right now is credit so credit democratize means that millions of individuals and millions of businesses will be able to get access to credit using the account aggregator we are doing about five six million transactions now but I think in the next three to four years this is going to be big and have an impact on all kinds of markets and create all kinds of new businesses that will use this stuff so fundamentally the way to think about it is the approach we have of DPI in the you know it's not only it's not government application it's not about just government providing services nor is it only markets providing services so that you know big players emerge it's about a balance between creating interoperable standards creating protocols creating platforms and then allowing Innovation to happen so it's the best balance between public and private and that's actually what the internet was if you go back and Rewind the internet was actually built by the government US government and between you know 1980 to 1995 or whatever it was entirely a government thing you you used uh you know all kinds of things on on the internet but it's only in 1991 when the browser when the World Wide Web was invented at CERN in Switzerland and they put out the specs for HTTP and HTML suddenly you could point and click and go to another website and then to make that much more user friendly the Mosaic was designed again as a public product in 1994 you could click and go anywhere on your on your on your thing and Mosaic led to browser Netscape which then led to the private internet so the Private Internet only began in 1995. so there again you had government enabling internet your open protocols HTTP HTML SMTP and so on and then you had applications Google Facebook and all that similarly GPS was a public infrastructure built by the US government GPS had had the apis the apis were available in here and then you could build Google Maps and Uber and travel because of the fact that below the hood you had infrastructure like GPS so this is not a new idea but what we have done in India is taking it forward we applied it to Identity we applied to payment we're applying to data and so on so it's taking the internet further into this approach which encourages competition and Innovation and today you know billions of dollars of market capitalization has been created by by this infrastructure right Geo benefited from it phone pay Google pay so many startups that are all using this so this is a very important approach where you combine the best and the public and the private now it's not just the Deep one is dpi's help Market Innovation but it also helps the government which is the original reason for doing this so when we did aadhar then we used aadhar kyc to open bank accounts then we built a direct cash transfer pipe where I can send money to anybody's other number and then somewhere in the system it decodes to the bank account and credits the money so this is the direct benefit transfer system we have we have the world's largest direct benefit transfer system and today you cumulatively since beginning 310 billion dollars has been transferred electronically in real time into people's bank accounts so it's a it's a huge thing and more than one billion transactions it also has meant that all this digitization is also leading to formalization so formalization means more people are becoming part of the formal economy because the identity bank accounts they pay for GST and all that and therefore India has seen a consistent increase in taxes which are the rate of tax increase growth increases higher than the rate of economic growth in other words the because of formalization because of Technology because of compliance improving more people are paying taxes and the revenue of the government is going faster than the rate of GDP growth which is very important if you want more money to spend on infrastructure or to give benefits or whatever you want so it's very important that we are creating the infrastructure for formalization all this is creating the infrastructure for formalization so on the revenue side you're making more money government is making more money and on the expenditure side the government is becoming more efficient because the money goes straight to the beneficiaries so on both sides you're improving the productivity of the economy this is also the reason why Indian stock markets have been much more stable historically since liberalization India has depended on foreign institutional investors who would come in and then something happened some guy sitting in Washington would increase the interest rate and all the money would go out and then the Indian markets would catch a cold but in the last few years the money coming in from domestic investors has been dramatic and that has actually helped the markets so when the when the foreign investors go away the Indian investors hold it up and then when the foreign investor come back the combination of this drives markets to new highs which is what is happening today so it's very important to realize what is happening and the reason for this is the biggest part of this is sip systemic investment plans and sip is essentially instructions you give to your bank or to your employer to deduct X rupees a month or week or whatever and give it to some mutual fund and those sip mandates are growing dramatically and all the sap mandates use UPI and auto pay so you deduct from a UPI bank account and then you give an auto pay instruction that every month deduct 500 rupees from a bank account and put it into some HDFC mutual fund or whatever and it is and that is now giving us about 12 000 crores a month of money is Flowing from private retail investors into the capital markets and that is the foundational strength of our Capital markets that there's a massive flow of money almost one and a half billion dollars a month into people's bank accounts that is enabled by technology today in an IPO fifty percent of the applications use UPI asthma which means as by the way asba works is that you deduct you apply for IPO you reserve money for your IPO in your bank account and when you actually get the allotment only then you debit your account the 50 of the applications use asba so this is all infrastructure which is possible on your phone because of the things we have so these only contain the world where we have population scale apis and networks to transform Society this is the phone pay data of payments from their pulse system it shows that this is you know all over the place it's not just a urban phenomenon it's all over uh the usage of these Technologies all over now all this was possible because India also has deep Talent density Talent density has come from the growth of the I.T industry the IT industry firms like Infosys and all that today that Industries are 227 billion dollar industry employing close to 5 million people and that has provided both the financial stability because the 200 600 billion dollars of reserves of India comes from the fact that these guys send back hundreds of millions of dollars of money and it has come from uh the uh you know the uh the talent has come from this and this is just GitHub data GitHub data already India is number three on GitHub in terms of developers and since the Chinese are moving out of GitHub it will be number two very shortly because they're having their own GitHub because they don't trust this American GitHub you know one day they'll be blocked or something like that so uh so it just shows that the whole developer ecosystem and macro stability is helping create the startup Revolution but also the startup ecosystem itself has grown dramatically and this all stuff that you guys are familiar with I'm sorry I didn't choose to take one of your data points but in in 2016 the same year what happened in 2016 if other one billion UPI launched demonetization jio launched 1000 startups now 90 000 startups you can see that how the game changed in seven years another way to look at it is how data has become so important you can look at the IPL broadcasting rights the first IPL auction was for this three years 2018 it is only for television there was no concept of digital and then by 2018 which is two years after that seminal Year little bit of digital by 2023 the digital rights which I bought by jio where more than the television rights which are bought by star all happened in the Flash of an eye and you know in 2016 guys are sitting huddling in some shop watching cricket 2020 they were watching on their own phones this is a change and then of course shark tank and all that stuff in 2012 the IIT entrance exam topper said I want to be a scientist in 2021 the topper said I want to be Elon Musk in other words the mental mind shift of young graduates from wanting to be scientists and going abroad to being entrepreneurs happen in six seven years and also the whole alumni networks of startups right it's like nuclear fission it keeps exploding right so there are 113 startups founded by myntra alumni and their 3 and 18 startups funded started by Flipkart alumni so each begets more right so a guy who's part of a founding team or even work somewhere becomes a star so that's why we went from 1000 startups to 19 000 startups even as India's digital infrastructure took off uh in this in this scale and huge amount of money raised by these guys and then what happened was that this led to digital natives so Aether and Ola started doing EVS but then the incumbents had couldn't had to catch up and now you have hero and Bajaj and TVs making EVS because they have these new guys have taken them on or Nika starts fashion and now Tata wants to sell in New Or you know all these new Banks started and hence Yono SBI Cherry kotak so what this has done is increase the competition on incumbents where incumbents had to respond to digital Natives and had to respond with their own challenges so you're increasing the economic intensity of competition in the country so what is happening at a mega level over the next 10 15 years India is going from an offline cash informal low productivity economy to an online cashless formal hybrid economy right it's going from offline to online billion people will use this on their phones UPI and other things they're going to go to cashless formalization will be driven by digitization so it's going to have many more people like better taxes and productivity will go up instead of taking one week to open the bank account you open a bank in two minutes when you open a billion bank accounts that's billions of minutes saved when the truck driving a truck going on the highway instead of taking 10 minutes to pay toll takes two seconds that's millions of minutes saved so across the board the many many examples of how digitization at scale is going to reduce transaction cost improve productivity improve trust reduce Discovery Time improve Supply chains so this is all happening you know you guys are documenting this and but this is a slow process but we're on this trajectory of going from here to here and what are the big three things that we believe will happen clearly credit I talked about credit e-commerce and Logistics so on credit essentially India was is not a high India actually credit to GDP ratio where it's not much it's 60 60 percent of PDP whereas China is on 300 or something so there's a lot of credit so India is an underserved market for credit moreover the credit in India goes only to the big guys so only big guys can go to Banks and get money because they can spend time doing the appraisal and showing their assets small guys don't get money but essentially that this technology that we are going to have will enable smaller and smaller value loans which is what is already happening loans values are coming down but we think this is going to dramatically change thanks to digitization account aggregator and so on so the huge change which is happening and now we have the concept of information collateral which is replaces physical collateral or what you call as digital Capital so we thought of capital as land and labor and money and so on but your digital footprint your transaction history itself is a form of capital and essentially our infrastructure will unlock that Capital at scale for everyone to get access so you know using a and so on and suddenly everybody has monetizable digital Capital which they can then use to get access to credit and then whole Supply chains will get simplified GST single you know single tax across the country India is only country in the world where not only but one of you can both indirect and direct us is completely automated so everyone files income tax returns online everyone pays GST online and the way the GST is designed is that when you pay GST the money is divided at the point of payment so suppose you have to pay thousand rupees GST 500 rupees goes to government of India 500 rupees goes to Karnataka State when you pay the bank at that point only divides and goes into two accounts so neither the central government touches the state's money nor does the state government touch the central government money right then we have e-way Bill so e-way bills for example when a truck passes through a point you have an Eva bill and I can electronically read my eBay bill I don't have to open the truck I can do only random checking reduces times at interstate borders fast tag we talked about then the huge host of physical infrastructure better roads better highways better warehouses better ports Etc combined with startups doing all kinds of very amazing things and you know we're going to hold create a whole efficiency in the logistics side and then of course ondc will change the whole Commerce space because you are now going to open up commas in multiple ways one is you're going to increase the inclusion in Commerce every small retailer can now be in Commerce because he just has to hook up with ondc so they're going to have massive increase in that hyperlocal Commerce will take off because it's very easy for me to order from my neighborhood store because he's listed on ondc and I can order it complex Commerce will take off which means if I have to have a Commerce it involves three four parties uh somebody you buy the furniture unbundled from Ikea somebody does assembly somebody else you can actually build a scripting flow on ondc to to create this thing and you know you know and it's going to change Mobility is it going to change e-commerce it's going to change food everything is going to change because you'll now have specialist supplier aggregators you love Specialists distribution companies and therefore once you unbundle then the consumer experience can come from anywhere so you can order on a hyper Local app like pin code from uh you know phone pay the shop may be listed by some magic pin and the delivery is done by denzo you can do that in one seamless transaction so fundamentally the unbundling is going to make huge impact on Commerce and lead to massive inclusion so cheaper credit wider Discovery and better Logics will commoditize a supply chain now this is something like what we did on the digital side on the digital side rise of digital advertising type for payments web services we could actually create full stack to create digital companies which is what we are by we see so many companies we can just put that together the same thing will happen on the physical side credit ondc uplogistics will all come together and essentially make the whole Discovery and fulfillment across the National Market much much simpler and then of course we have initiatives like AI for Indian languages we have an initiative called barshini government initiative we have a group at IIT Madras AI for Bharat which has built the biggest language model for all Indian languages and it's all open source anybody can use it so tomorrow you can use any data from here your app can talk in any language Etc translate into any language suddenly language becomes accessible so the you know when we had laptops we had to have keyboards so people had to know how to read and write in English and all that then you had phones where you could use touch but you still had to be literate now with vashini and AI you use voice commands and receive and behind the scene there can be you know chart GPT whatever you want and fundamentally imagine every Indian in their own language in a voice command can operate a phone and get all the knowledge on the planet what else do you want so weird thing about it is that what you're seeing is each of these things are building blocks I.T Services let identities India's Chief smartphones so all these things are coming together and this is why you're going to get that economic activity you all talking about going to that 10 trillion dollar economy so fundamentally it's a different model of growth it's not happened before so people are not able to put their heads around it but fundamentally it's a different model of inclusive growth which is much more democratic which opportunity a population scale and which we think will lead to a very better future thank you thank you [Music] thank you [Music]
