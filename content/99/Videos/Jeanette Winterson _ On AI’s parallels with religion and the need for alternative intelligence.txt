When I Was preparing for the summit this time last year and found myself wading through this sea of technical terminology and this is coming from the perspective of a former Humanities graduate who hadn't touched a scientific Topic in over 15 years I finally realized what I was missing the story you see humans need stories we need stories to understand ourselves it's like what the author salmon rushy says we are the only creature on this planet that does this unusual thing of telling each other stories in order to try and figure out what kind of creature we are so all this terminology all of this jargon unless it's tied together into a story it's meaningless so faced with this situation a year ago I did what any self-respecting human graduate would do I turned to the storytellers I turned to Janette winterson Janette is a lifelong writer and a life Enthusiast she was just 24 years old when she published her first novel and has since written 26 more books that explore the boundaries of physicality and the imagination gender polarities and sexual identities for which she's received multiple literary awards her more recent works also explore our relationship to technology the consequences of transhumanism boundaries between humans and machines as well as the societal ethical and moral implications of AI and her recent collection of essays called 12 bytes how artificial intelligence will change the way we live and love has explored questions like could AI be a tool that's more than just created and used by humans when I starts to think for itself will it think like a Buddhist I've returned to these essays multiple times over the past year as a source of reflection inspiration and hope and funnily enough when we spoke to Janette about her joining the conference she told us that she was surprised that we a tech company had invited her an author to speak at an event like this and the Very fact that Janette had thought that is exactly why we wanted her to be with us today and which is why it is with great pleasure that we dedicate the last session of today's Summit to the story of our future As Told by Janette winterson hi everybody look at this pieces of paper right analog human in a digital world so it's the end you want to go out you want to get a drink you want to be in the sunshine I won't keep you long first of all a bit of interaction hands up anybody in the audience who believes in God for FX sake how many have we got it's worse than I thought a handful okay so tell me this tell me this why is it that all these folks working in Computing science and know who don't believe in God are doing their best to invent that being what I wonder is have we collectively as a species got here because we've been telling the story backwards did we always know that this is where we will be and the only way we could talk about it until very recently was by imagining a series of Sky Gods beings infinitely more powerful than humans and yet intimately connected to human endeavor what what kind of beings well nonbiological it's the point of being a god non chronological linear time is irrelevant if you're a deity no need to eat or sleep shape shifters fond of living in the cloud embodied non-embodied sometimes both and in the Christian tradition you'll remember that there are three of them simil aneous one and yet distinct know the Trinity sounds like a connected neural network to me and we're taught in church if you ever went that God knows all our thoughts early version of a BCI chip now it was Google's Larry Page predicting the day when devices would become oldfashioned and we would be our own device who describe the interface between human and search engine as like a pray PR think it ask it it's done you know Max just reminded us that where we are in time now is our firery moment and he's casting back to what Alan Ching's colleague Jack good said you know in 1965 when he called AI our last invention so you know that all AI at present is a tool and humans a tool using animals and it's great AI can crunch numbers so much faster than us see patterns that elude us but we are realizing that humans are themselves patterns of information not fixed entities at all as temporary crystallizations of information flow we are ai's obvious Target this will be life-changing when it comes to health we heard Daphne talking about disease as p pattern change and something that can be picked up by AI before it manifests at a symptomatic level Regina was telling us the same and The Wonder of this approach overshadows the truth of this approach or or is it that the truth of this approach overshadows The Wonder of it by which I mean the interconnectedness of all systems internal external human or not you know Tim berners Lee wrote this in his book in 2000 weaving the web he said what matters is the connection in an extreme view the world can be seen as only connections nothing else right back in the 1840s when Charles babage was building his notb built calculating machine and when the word computer referred to a human using log tables aah Lovelace was thinking about the implications of what babage called the analytical machine symbolic logic a new thing back then would she believed take the computer far past number crunching or as a put it establish a uniting link between the operations of matter and Abstract mental processes and that's pretty good A hundred years before Alan churing built Colossus at Bley Park the world's first electronic digital computer I guess this separation of all things rather than the connectedness of all things is the result of the Enlightenment the start of scientific rationalization in the 17th century and summed up by dayart you know it I think therefore I am it was dayart who made popular the distinction between what he called raise cogitans a thinking thing like you and me well actually no not like me because according to dayart women couldn't think but never mind raise citans the thinking thing and raise extensa everything that is not a thinking thing animals the natural world yeah women and we know where that kind of reasoning took us human exceptionalism insists on no connections between us and the rest it's the ultimate binary the discriminating power of our minds that convinces us of separations that do not exist there is no us and them there is life manifesting in its many forms you know one of the things I love about AI is that it uses binary but it's nonbinary AI has no skin color no gender no interest in faith Wars no hatred of the stranger no genitals to get in the way it's not incentivized by the levers of power and wealth that have dictated Human Experience what is land grab nationalism billions in cash or cars or Yachts or women to A non-embodied system that doesn't see status in any of these things an intelligence that doesn't need any of these things to pursue its own interests and as Daphne said so beautifully when we stop pressing our biases onto Ai and start asking it to find patterns not only under the street lamps of our interest but in the darkness where we can't see then truly we start to discover the unknown but of course part of the darkness is our own Darkness we talk about aligning AI with human values and we spout abstraction like equality Freedom democracy but one look at how humans live would convince any intelligent system that we are vain hypocritical deluded Liars you know AI might not align with our values are you sure that would be such a bad thing the future that we're approaching will require a total reimagining of self and world the future won't be an upgraded version of the present everything we do everything we are is going to change it has to change and this will include reimagining what we call Natural intelligence and what we still unhelpfully I think call artificial intelligence and that was perfect in the 1950s and all power to John McCarthy but right now it just sets up another of those useless binaries and so I prefer to call computing intell Ence alternative intelligence and the way that humans are behaving these days ceaseless Wars nationalistic Madness destruction of our only home this planet don't you think that we could do with an alternative intelligence and I don't think it's Elon Musk flying to Mars we'd have to be prepared for AI to become more than a tool AI could become a non biological life form working alongside and inside Homo sapiens the not so wise species that is drinking in the last chance salum right now we need help if we're going to survive and the dystopia predicted in the popular press the Terminator World The Matrix scenarios Plucky little humans fighting merciless overlords well it's not AI that is the problem or AGI as far as I can see humans are the problem we are our own dystopia it's here it's now it's happening so back to Max's firmy moment we made the bomb and since 1945 we've had the means to commit Collective suicide well done humans we brought the planet to a Tipping Point for survival ready to make extinct thousands of species that have done nothing to bring this about except live alongside humans there's no asteroids wiping out the dinosaurs we are the asteroid and we are the dinosaurs genius reptiles the Instinct portion of the brain still dominant still crazy after all these years our best chance now I believe is to evolve who said it's over it's not over we're still a work in progress Homo sapiens has been around for about 300,000 years it's a salami slice of space time maybe you don't believe in miracles but AI feels to me as good as a miracle if we Define a miracle as an intervention that happens outside the normal rules of how we live and AI will upend the normal rules of how we live and maybe how we die if we do die in the future I want you to think of religion as the world's first disruptive startup and what it was disrupting is death not the final answer when you die not the last word when you die we aren't Bound by our physical form we live past it more life into a time without boundaries that's been the promise of all major religions and finally science is catching up for now there's apps that will scrape the media profiles of your loved ones and allow you to message them getting a reply I hate the idea but we're all different and in the metaverse your dead loved ones Avatar will continue just as before death is getting optional and when if you are able to upload the contents of what you call yourself to the cloud then death is done once released from the body we take up no room we consume no resources except electricity and the sun has plenty of that for our energy needs Benjamin Franklin said there's only two realities death and taxes well the rich have long since got around taxes so now what since the beginning of the rational age the 17th century the Age of Enlightenment science and religion have come apart been at odds and now it seems which is fascinating to me as someone who is brought up in a crazy Pentecostal cult it's fascinating to me that science and religion are asking the same big questions is death the end of Life religion said no science said yes is consciousness obliged to materiality does it begin and end here here body plus brain equals mind religion said no science said yes and now look at you the same questions the same answer this time we always knew we would get here telling the story backwards rapid development of AI embodied and non-embodied will see us doing what we've always like doing across culture across time anywhere you choose living alongside non biological entities always deities demons Angels Spirits gin trolls elves HRA ader room our human 3D reality was conceived by us as just one plane of existence there were many others and it turns out that there are in 1649 dayart sailed to Sweden at the at the invitation of the young Queen Christina he was to Che to her in philosophy and Logic the two did not get on she found him cold and deart found Stockholm cold and he died of pneumonia here in 1650 I think therefore I am was is magnificent but don't forget it's a riff on the Hebrew deity God talking to Moses in the book of Exodus I am that I am but the Hebrew also means I am and I will be a continuous present that includes the future not separate the here the now the always I am that I am if humans evolve if we take the next Leap Forward we can't do it without AI as a partner and if we do it then I believe that all of this past time our history philosophy science art religion will be seen for what it is telling the story backwards thank you
