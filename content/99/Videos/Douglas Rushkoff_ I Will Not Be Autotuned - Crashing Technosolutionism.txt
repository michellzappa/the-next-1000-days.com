hey yeah All Tech Bros are human don't tell them that right they would disagree that's really what it comes down to isn't it you know I I don't necessarily like Tech Bros but I like talking with tech Bros and at Tech Bros because they're easy to upset you know and that's then the main way you upset them is by asserting either their Humanity or everyone else's Humanity that's that's the whole thing I mean the the I mean the the obligatory story um of this book is this uh and it's gotten painted weirdly by the media like I was taken out to a James Bond secret headquarters of a bunch of tech Pros who wanted advice on planning their bunkers and all the reality is I was invited out I mean we're friends right um I was invited out to a uh it was this hedge fund that invited like their 50 or their 100 biggest billionaire investor people to this weekend and they had like a celebrity chef they had a pro golfer they had a swim guy they had like these different and and they had a menu and the billionaire dudes signed up like okay so you know Thursday 11 A.M you had a choice right you can get your hair done you could work on your golf swing or you could talk about futurism with Douglas rushkoff right so this is why there were only five dudes right I thought I was supposed to go out there to do this talk on the digital future you know what I usually do and just try to make people angry you know wealthy people upset by telling them what this technology is for and all that and their business plans are stupid and why they're killing the world um you know I've got my great it's basically I get hired as a kind of intellectual dominatrix by wealthy people you know tell them what they're doing wrong and they're like thank you sir may I please have another right you know the ones who don't have time to do the full Ayahuasca trip they just come to me I harsh their mellow for an hour and then they go back to killing people um but what I do see the reason why I find it fun maybe I am an intellectual dominatrix is I just love to tweak them I I hear their stupid thing and then I try to challenge it in a way that gives them the opportunity to see what they're doing is stupid but nine times out of ten they just double down on the thing right so this was this this I thought I was doing a talk and they they were just you know peppering me with all these really binary questions that they ask people that they think are smart you know like do I bet on on bitcoin or ethereum right augmented reality or virtual reality and I'm not the person you ask that right I would have said CompuServe not AOL right betamax not VHS you know I vote for the better technology usually not the thing that wins um so I'm the wrong person to ask those but they're asking me those things and then finally they got to that question you know Alaska or New Zealand right which is the better place to put their bunker and I was like ooh this will be fun right these are crazy Tech Bros right who are at their bunkers so I start trying to tweak them to the point where they realize their idea is stupid I'm like so where are you going to be getting the water and is it going to be contaminated I'm trying to sort of uh show them the fallacy of what they're thinking I'm like well how are you going to guard this place from the rest of us right didn't you see the Twilight Zone everybody's banging on the door of the of the bomb shelter and they're like oh we've got Navy Seals that are coming you know they're on standby they're fully gassed helicopters you know in standby mode ready to come and they're oh Navy Seals right oh so how are you going to pay for your Navy Seals like oh if you've got millions of dollars it's like how are you going to pay for your Navy Seals after your money is worthless because the apocalypse has happened right so one of the guys opens his little moleskin book and he's like how to pay for the Navy Seals I have anything right and they start going through these iterations of like oh well you know well we could have the be I'll be the only one who knows the combination to the safe where we keep the food it's like oh Navy Seals have never had to get information out of anybody right you're going to spend your apocalypse getting waterboarded right yeah you know it was just on and on so the further I tweaked them the further they went into their into their uh Insanity right they kept doubling down on that and that's the thing I I kind of want to teach people how to do how do you tweak a tech bro and then to see if they're salvageable if you can get them to see you know the human part right they all take as human part of it or or are they are they truly hopeless and what what I realized with these guys and they are human right is that these are not rational plans to escape the Apocalypse they're not right climate change and global warming and economic disparity and all that their fears these are the excuses for them to build the things they've wanted to build all along for their sea studying Mars mission virtual reality upload their mind escape from us that's what they've wanted from the beginning I remember when I I was with Timothy Leary when he read Stuart Brand's book um uh what was it media lab about Nicholas negroponi's media lab at where are you at MIT and and he's he's at MIT um and but he's like a a spiritual person there it's different he's not he's not one of them um he's a human um trying anyway um but he's reading this book and I'm thinking he's loving it because he's circulating everything in flare pens and all and he gets to the end of this book about media lab you know the first well you guys know media lab is and he throws it across the room and he goes blah like he's vomiting and I go what what this is like late 80s by the way and he says first less than three percent of the names in the index are women right in the late 80s most people didn't notice things like that and he goes this is that's how you know they're on the wrong track and he said second these guys are trying to recreate the womb right their mothers he was a psychologist their mothers were unable to anticipate their every every need when they were babies and now they want to recreate a technological womb that will anticipate their every need and bring it to them before they even know they want it right the desire to disconnect you say I've always blamed capitalism for what happened to the net right I tell my story about Mono 2000 and psychedelics and designer reality and fractals and Rave and fantasy role-playing and hypertext and Hyper card stacks and remember the net that we were going to do then Wired Magazine comes along and reframes it as a business phenomenon right oh this is the Salvation of the NASDAQ Stock Exchange we're in the middle of the long Boom the economy is going to expand exponentially infinitely forever uninterrupted globally yay right they believed it Alan Greenspan even said we're in a new paradigm right it's all going to keep just grow and I was like huh right what happens when you turn the net from a creative A A Creative Source of new possibility into an investment opportunity well you've got to reduce possibility down to probability right once you're betting on something you want the probable outcome that you bet it on not the unpredictable novel possibilities right so for me the net kind of reversed at that point it became less about being open and crazy and more about narrowing down and we started rather than thinking about these Technologies as tools for people to use to express themselves we started to think about them as tools to use on people to get them to behave appropriately to their statistical algorithm right we use tools on people instead of giving tools to people so I looked at those reversals but then when I think back on Leary and I look at these Tech Bros and realize oh it's not that the money corrupted them it's that the money and the finance dovetails it supports their original Vision right because you think about what Finance is finance is most simply Finance is an abstraction in on human interaction right I want to buy something from you you want we want to have an exchange what's the finance person do I'm going to give them the money that they use to have that transaction right they made local currencies illegal this is all way back in medieval times they made local currencies illegal so they could lend money to us for the transaction so we have to pay someone else then someone else looks at that and goes oh well I'm going to make money off the bank by having stocks or I'm going to make money off the stocks by having derivatives right so what what we see is finance is successive layers of abstraction around actual exchange of value you know it got so bad the New York Stock Exchange was actually purchased by its derivatives Exchange in 2013. right the stock market which is an abstraction of the market which is an extraction of human need was consumed by its own abstraction why because it was Amplified by digital technology right by Ultra fast trading and algorithms and all that because digital is what an abstraction and MP3 is not a song it is a numerical representation of a song algorithmically treated to make your ears think you're listening to music but you're not right you're listening to an algorithm it's and it's only in your ears not even in your body but that's not let's not get human here right but the two things end up dovetailing and they end up making it so that the original kind of tech Bro Science nerd need to separate from humanity and nature can be realized right the more abstract you go the less you are right you're not here right you're remembered Zuck in in his original meta right yay no balls to worry about right I'm just Caesar up there right pure Caesar right so you go meta right you go meta on reality and this is you all know you know the the original promise of empirical science in the late Middle Ages was what or a Renaissance was Francis Bacon and how did he sell empirical science he said science will let us take Nature by the forelock hold her down and submit her to our will this is what Trump's on trial for right now right this is a rape fantasy if I may use that word the forelock is the hair hold her down by her hair and submit her to our will that's what science is going to do let us control nature which is this wild woman right A Dark Moon Woods fairies worms soil strangeness complexity right we're going to reduce it down to cause and effect to nice little quantifiables anything we can quantify is here anything we can't is not so bacon did that to the natural world right capitalism did that to labor right which is humans so what do you end up with when we come into a digital age if we don't check that mentality at the door we end up with well first we got social media which is what about what about controlling human beings then we get artificial intelligence which is really about replacing people although the way I like to think about it now is social media was like the missionaries right the missionaries went to to South America and the Americas First they come they soften up the people convert them to Christianity do lots of Intelligence on how they think and how they work send that intelligence back to the crown then who comes conquistadors right social media was like the missionaries but the AI or the Conquistadors using all the information that they've gathered and they come in for the kill thank you you know when I was funny I was talking to one of those same Tech Pros about about AIS and he said rushkov I'm really worried about you you write all this stuff that's critical of the AIS what do you think they're going to do when they're in charge and he says I don't write anything at all I don't post anything I say nothing about AIS and I said to him again the Tweet well if the AIS are so smart aren't they going to be able to see that you selectively withheld any opinion about Ai and be able to infer from that selective withholding how you actually feel he's like oh right and you're right you know there are there are these sort of two ways of looking at AI there's even two camps that are afraid of AI right now right there's the the the crazier the tech bro camp that is afraid of the existential Doom of AI right AI is going to AI is going to rise before I get on my Mars rocket right that's why these guys sign that thing the first name's on there right the AIS are coming quick you know we're not gonna they're going fast right we got just six months six months to get my rocket going right six months to get my mind up into you know kurzweil's Google server right it's just six months right there's those guys and then there's the people who've been afraid or upset about Ai and algorithms all along the people who are looking at well look at the way um algorithms decide prison sentences and put black people in jail longer than white people why is that right because of their sample but I'm starting to think that that the problem is when we again if we apply an all-tech is human model to this and I actually think I'll take his nature because I like beaver dams and stuff like that I think of his but that's another story but if we apply the All Tech is human model to AIS all of a sudden you realize what are what are AIS Le if they are essentially human extension of human rather than derivative and abstracted what if we think of them as essential as as extension well the thing that when we look at AIS and we're upset what we're upset about is that AIS basically amplify and and exacerbate whatever are the embedded values in the data set that they're modeling right so if we give them marketing data and we give them that then they become really good at marketing right even if we try to give them good data sets like we try to give the sentencing algorithms good data sets they see through to our innate racism so what's the what's that we think about our children right it doesn't matter what you tell your children right what matters is they're sitting in the back seat and they see you curse at the person that just cut you off and that's what they absorb right the data set on which we are feeding our AIS is us it's what we're actually doing we have created a situation where we have a generation of very powerful children learning how to be based on how we are right in some ways we've given ourselves the ultimate test here right we've created an instant tech Karma machine right the only way to raise appropriately behaving AIS is to begin behaving appropriately ourselves we painted ourselves into a corner where we've got to start being nice to each other we actually do that's that's the real choice so then you know what what I've been doing then is working on how do we do that right how do we and this is the troubling word it's what we can't use and you would as a a a a rabbi can I call you what what Pastor would understand you can't get people to be nice once you even use the phrase I want to get people to blank you up right it's the tech Bros who are trying to get people to do this and get people to do that because we know the solution and we're going to get people to follow it I don't care how great the thing you believe is once you're trying to get someone to do it or get someone to believe it you're manipulating you've created the Power differential you up it's over right now you know better than them and we'll just oh just mean ends justifies the means as long as we get people to do that thing so I'm thinking instead of that and the language isn't exactly right yet but rather than getting people to do something which is just a kind of an artifact of digital industrialism or techno solutionism where where using Tech on people or using our ideas on people I'm thinking more about how do we change the register how do we change the environment so rather than trying to move the water you try to dig the ground so the water naturally goes somewhere else right how do we how do we work on that and so I came up really with four things and I realize these are sort of the the things that I've been working on for for 20 years the first one the first way to do this is to denaturalize power right and that's it sounds fancy but all I really mean is have people able to recognize the difference between Human Social constructions and conditions of nature right when you say oh uh oh I gotta have a car because I need to get to work whoa wait a minute whoa all right why do you need a car to get to work because GM came and moved your work far away from your house right but why do you need to work because I need a job why do you need a job when were Jobs invented right jobs were invented very specifically in the late Middle Ages in order to prevent people from creating value themselves they created chartered monopolies so people started at work be employed and sell their time rather than their value all those things Central money this is money I gotta earn money well this is not money right this is the paper that we use to represent a money system that is inherently exploitative right this is time is what this is if it's closer to time than it is to money this is an interest-bearing currency that has to be that we this requires us to grow the economy every year in order to support the bankers who make it there's no reason for the GDP to grow there's no reason this that's right so you've got to ever be able to question those things the only way you can question this is what I was really writing about my book life Inc where did this thing come from who made it why did they make it where are they oh they've long since left the building right we are running a 21st century economy on a 13th century economic operating system developed by monarchs who are afraid of the rise of the burgers or the middle class and we're wondering why it isn't working right once you're able to denaturalize power right to question these things that should trigger agency right that's my second one how do we trigger Agency for me agency was triggered it was um first time I used a real uh Mainframe computer I had to save a file I remember the woman came over the grad student she's like how do you want to save the file uh read only or read write like what the a read write I read write it means you can save a file that someone else can then open it and edit it like oh let's save read write and then I start looking at TV and I go well TV is read only why isn't it read write money is read only religion is read only why isn't it read write because these were saved as read they made laws to make them read only because if we read write then we're participating so all of a sudden that moment triggered my agency to look at what else could be read right here what else is up for discussion what's not up for discussion why is it not up for discussion and who's going to shoot me if I start discussing it right that's what this program every program was about right if you are not doing the programming so our chances are somebody's programming you then the third one is you can't get any of this done alone so the third one is re-socialize people or I like better now re-socialize the people because it's got a little Lefty uh bite to it right and that was sort of my whole team human idea that you don't go through this alone you've got to establish Rapport in order to have solidarity the technologies that we're using were built intentionally to isolate us from one another right even the ones that are really helping us connect like Zoom you don't really connect right you don't really make eye contact I can't see if your pupils are getting larger or smaller when you say you agree with me right can't see the micro emotions of your head so you say you agree I don't feel it in my body and what happens it triggers distrust instead of mirror neurons firing and oxytocin going through my blood you know at best dopamine but chances are norepinephrine is going to pop up right it's like watch Real Housewives they're always there you know well the reason they can't it's because they have so much Botox in their face that they can't make facial expressions that are consonant with what they're saying but it's the same sense of distrust right you're not getting we've we've 500 000 years of painstakingly evolved cues for social bonding that are being defeated in all of our digital interactions and we're not compensating for it we're not even staying aware of it so we re-socialize people right we break the whole Tech bro  mythology of that Darwin was talking about survival the fittest individual that Darwin and Ein Rand or some that's not good was Bart Darwin was talking about Darwin read the Darwin he's marveling page after page after Page look how all these different species are collaborating and cooperating in order to ensure Mutual survival there's like three paragraphs on on uh survival of the fittest it's like one little to be sure paragraph not the rest of it is more like secret life of trees where they're all the roots are under the ground with Mycelia sharing nutrients and you know the story you were told in middle school too right the big tree crowds at the little tree so it doesn't get sung right and the little one it's not what happens the Big Trees giving nutrients to the little tree during the summer then it loses its leaves and the little Evergreen then gives nutrients back to the big one and it's Mycelia the mushrooms that teach them how to do it right but you give it Tech bro mushrooms it's just a tech bro on mushrooms I was so surprised right but back to Leary it's set and setting right right set and setting finally though the fourth one then is cultivate awe and this is really undervalued in our society right now this is kind of what my book present shock was about was what happens when you don't get all right that that when you when you experience all you move from dopamine into oxytocin we know now scientifically if you've had an experience of awe you know like a looking at a mountain feeling that sense of one connection with everything else when you've had an experience of awe your cytokines respond your your immune system gets better you're more generous for like three days after experience of all you actually give more money to other people interestingly enough you know billionaires their their uh mirror neurons don't light up they billionaires are sociopathic you put a billionaire there's studies they're in the book you put a billionaire in an MRI machine and show them a picture of a starving baby and the part of the brain that for you and me lights up doesn't even light up anymore doesn't even go right and I would say it's more cause and effect they didn't start out that way I think in order to become a billionaire you've got to get used to externalizing so much harm to others but you don't you don't see it right but when you get connected to everything you you it engenders something else the other reason why I like cultivating awe is it's so distinctly human right the awe is that weird unknown squishy stuff right the ah is the weird only human ah ineffable stuff that gives us a reason to be here that gives us a reason to say yes we humans need to be here in addition to whatever AIS you think are supposed to be our our evolutionary successors human I got in this argument with uh with Kurzweil where he was saying Doug you have to you know we got to pass the evolutionary torch to the to the machines because that's what's happening I'm like no but people are so weird and Squishy and interesting we can watch a David Lynch movie and not understand what it means and still experience that as pleasure what is that right an AI can't do that and he goes oh rushka if you're just saying that because you're human right like it's hubris I go fine guilty I'm on team human that's when that's when I came up with that idea right but when you are when you are connected to everything when you are when you are denaturalizing power triggering agency re-socializing people and cultivating awe you realize that economics and Technology while interesting they are the last resort for when things aren't working the only reason to go to the economy to go to The Ledger is if someone is being exploited wait wait a minute this isn't fair then you go okay let's look and see you don't use the economy to orchestrate your civilization you don't use your technology to figure out how you want people to be you use technology when all this is just too hard I can't do it oh here's a piece of tech to help you right oh this feels unfair okay let's use an economic model to see why it feels unfair to you right the the bias of the inhuman digital media environment is from possibility toward probability right from possibility to probability you find the most and it's hard to argue against probability right well vaccine science probability right you want to do the thing that's most probably right and the more we listen to the machines the more we will do the things that are most probably right but at the expense of the improbable expense of the possible right that's why I wanted to call this about don't auto-tune me the Temptation with digital Tech is to auto-tune reality toward what we know is the right note and I get it for Ariana Grande and she's selling her music she's a good capitalist singer lovely thing right she wants to hit that right we're going to use audience we're going to get it right there honey you're going to be exactly on that 440 megahertz a it's perfect if it would have been if you're going to auto-tune James Brown imagine that James Brown he's reaching up for the net you got that note I'm sorry James [Music] not ah it's uh you're gonna auto-tune you right because we want the signal the signal is that note right the Signal's the exact note and the rest of that's your noise when we all Tech is human we realize no no no no no the note is the noise the note everyone does the same the signal is James Brown reaching up for the note the signal is to hear the human being on the other side of the song that's the whole point of the music not the notes but the singer but the player that's the human right the medium right the median is the message right the song is the excuse is the grid that we use to have this other human on the other side right when you when you look at a van Gogh I mean yeah we can get an AI to make a perfect Van Gogh like thing why is that not interesting because you don't look at a van Gogh for the pattern on your retina you look at the Van Gogh to think who was that tortured Soul on the other side of this painting what was he thinking and why do I feel that way too sometimes right you're connecting to that person not to an algorithm you could use it for wallpaper maybe but not right when you're reading you know I I was just reading it I was reading Beckett the other night because I just saw they they did this a great production of end game reading Beckett the other night and this this novel I don't know if you know Malloy it's this great novel by Beckett Samuel Beckett the playwright and I was reading it and this does happen to me I'm reading this book and there's a part of it that I'm like he wrote this for me this sentence he wrote this one for me and that was I promise you that was Beckett's Soul alive in that moment the human soul of Beckett connecting with mine we did that was time travel that was human to human interaction that that that that goes beyond the clock it goes beyond it goes beyond everything right that was me connecting with his soul and through the technology of a codex book right and all these Technologies can do that they can all do that if we remember right if we remember that as you would say All Tech is human okay thanks a lot [Applause]
