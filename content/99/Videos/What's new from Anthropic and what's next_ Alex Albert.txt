[Music] morning everyone so today I want to start with a uh a little story um a short history lesson if you will so you know sit back get comfortable uh I'm going to take us back to the year 188 too it's the dawn of the electrical Revolution really the world's first commercial power plant just opened up electricity this amazing new force is all the rage in the manufacturing industry people are claiming that it's going to change everything and yet something very interesting happened around this time or rather it didn't happen you see despite electricity's obvious superiority in comparison to the traditional techniques that the time like steam engines it didn't immediately improve manufacturing productivity why well because Factory owners were simply trying to replace their old technology with this new technology into an outdated Paradigm let's picture a typical Factory at the time so we have a huge cool fired steam engine on one end and we have a network of transmission lines going across the top all driving hundreds of machines locked in the same Rhythm these Legacy steam power factories were incredibly inefficient you know if one station needed power all of a sudden you had to turn on that entire steam engine and it had to power all of them Factory layouts were dictated by the limitations of the transmission lines not by what was best for the process or for the workers when electricity arrived many Factory owners simply swapped out the steam engine for an electric one and sure you know they added some lights and you know workers didn't have to toil next to a Coal Fired furnace all say but the fundamental limitations of the factory remained so this real electrical Revolution well it didn't actually come until we imagined factories from the ground up with electricity at its core factories started to become flexible and adaptable they allowed for smaller specialized tools workers could bring their tools to the items instead of having to Lug the items back to their workstations the entire Manu facturing process became more efficient more Humane and more productive now let's fast forward 140 something years to today and you can see that we find ourselves at a similar point in regards to Ai and llms Enterprises startups developers are all building and integrating LMS into their products but often they're just tacking it onto their existing product surface adding a few star icon buttons in the top left corner and calling it a day and this is not the first time we've seen this in Silicon Valley let's think back to when mobile first emerged right companies simply tried to just shrink down their website and put it on a phone it wasn't until we redesigned apps from the ground up with the unique capabilities of mobile like always on camera and GPS that we actually began to see true innovation in the space and adoption this is when the Snapchats and the Ubers of the world started to emerge so just as companies and just as factories went through their you know replace steam engines with electric one phase and tech companies went through their just hire a couple mobile web dev people phase we're now in our magic star icon phase with respect to Ai and yeah it's funny but the thing is you can't blame any of the companies or developers that are actually trying to do this right now right like all of us are trying to do this but in many ways we're just still so early llms are non-deterministic they're hard to build on they're completely different than what most developers are used to using reliability is still an issue prompts still take rounds and rounds of optimization and we've also just started to scratch the surface of potential product opportunities so far not much has really stuck Beyond just the text box we've been missing something something that's a little hard to put a finger on but just last week I think we scratched the surface of a potential new product future that we can build as some of you may have heard last Thursday we released our new model Claude 3.5 Sonet 3.5 Sonet is the first model that we released in the new Claude 3.5 family is only the middle model and yet it is better than our last best model Claude 3 Opus in my opinion Claude 3.5 Sonic is one of the best models in the world right now and the benchmarks seem to back it up MML human eval gpq tool use all the common characters here it's top of its class in many regards in these academic lab type environments but what I am most excited for is how it actually does in the real world the model is particularly strong in rag use cases thanks to its 200k context and also has near perfect recall over that entire context as well on coding tasks 3.5 Sonet seems to grasp debugging problems better it's not getting stuck in those same Loops as much as previous models one of the best methods that we found for actually measuring more complicated chains of reasoning is pull request they have a defined task they usually take a few steps to solve and the model is able to iteratively write and test its way to a solution in our own internal pull request EV valves we're seeing that cloud 3.5 Sonet scores a 64% and to put that number in comparison Claud 3 Opus only scored a 38% 3.5 Sonet also has state-of-the-art Vision abilities it shows considerable improvement over three Opus in basically every Benchmark that we tested it on things like table transcriptions and OCR are Breeze now passed this table in a uh 3.5 Sonet and basically replicated it perfectly and marked down um probably can't read all those numbers but trust me I I double checked them to make sure they're all right uh Vision capabilities were actually what amazed me the most when I started playing around with this model it feels like we are really on The Cutting Edge of unlocking so many more use cases and you know as you're hearing me say all this you might be thinking well that's great Alex but I mean it doesn't mean anything if I can't actually use the model and you're right and we heard you and that's why 3.5 son is available on RI AWS bedrock and vertex AI we understand that developers want Choice when they're building and we want CLA to be available wherever you are in terms of price ing 3.5 Sonet is five times cheaper than three Opus it's only $3 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens 3.5 sonnet's combo of speed intelligence and low cost makes it much more economical to use and embed in your apps than three Opus but 3.5 Sonet is not all that we've released in the past week we also released a new product feature that I think is actually more inspiring to developers in terms of thinking about in building those AI products from the ground up it's called artifacts artifacts separate the content that CLA produces from the actual chat dialogue itself this allows you to work collaboratively with Claude on things from essays to svgs to react websites artifacts become really powerful when you combine it with 3.5 Sonet those coding skills plus that reasoning ability plus that strong visual Acuity enables a new product experience that's really fun to use it's also a developer's best friend and that it allows you to quickly take screenshots and figma diagrams and quickly turn it into code and components that you can actually just go use uh as you can see in this I basically cloned her entire claw. a chat layout and react just from a single screenshot and this feature has practically been hiding in plain sight now uh just waiting really to be discovered for over a year and a half maybe this tweet is right and we really are early on this scurve of production productionizing llms which I think is actually pretty inspiring an artifact is not the only AI feature that we launched recently on Tuesday we released projects projects enables Dev teams to work and collaborate much more efficiently by grounding cla's outputs in your own knowledge whether it's style guides or code bases or transcripts or even your past work on our CLA team plan you can even share these projects and your chats with all your teammates at anthropic our Engineers now upload code repos and documentation that they use and I've started to see people actually just share the chats and the artifacts instead of Google docs or site documentation projects is another great example of when you think from an llm and an AI standpoint first you can actually start to build product experiences that compl these Technologies and don't feel like a simple add-on to what you already have so now that hopefully the creative product juices are flowing in everyone's Minds I want to dive a little bit into API improvements that we've rolled out recently and things that allow you to actually build this cool stuff I also want to give a preview of what's coming next that will enable you to build even more so a month ago we released our new tool use API tool use allows you to give Claude custom client side functions that it can then intelligently leverage tool use also enables things like consisted structure Json output with 3.5 son it I've actually started to seen devs give Claude hundreds of tools at a time on the developer console front we're also continuing to iterate we added a prompt generator that uses Claud to write prompts for you based on a task description so you can see in this video we put in a task description and then out comes a optimized prompt and then once that prompt is all done you can actually just start editing it right in the workbench itself you can see we've also added support for variables so you can edit prompt templates as well test things like rag use cases and finally we're also working on a new evaluate feature which is currently in console right now with a beta tag uh and we will plan to share more on this and continue to iterate on it very soon so what else is next um well there's there's two things that I can share right now first is that you can expect more models 3.5 ha cou and 3.5 Opus are coming later this year with each model generation we're looking to increase the intelligence decrease the latency and decrease the cost the number one thing that I tell developers is to not forget to build with that in mind models will become smarter cheaper and faster in orders of months not years when you're planning your product road map be ambitious enough to build with the belief that new models may arrive during your development period we are also working on other areas of research like interpretability in one of our latest papers called scaling monos semanticity we explained how we've been able to find features within models that activate for different topics once you identify a feature you're able to clamp its value and turn it up or down to actually steer the model's outputs a few weeks ago we showed claw. AI users how this worked through Golden Gate CLA which was a version of Claude that had the Golden Gate Bridge feature turned up significantly yeah fan favorite we currently have a few beta testers also experimenting with a steering API um this allows developers to find and clamp features for specific attributes and actually turn that dial up or down which again allows you to control cla's outputs in in addition to actually just prompting it we hope to be able to roll this out to more developers in the very near future as well now anything in this talk has sparked any ideas I want to encourage you guys to just go out there and build and make quick prototypes as fast as you can to get that validation and that feedback loop started and for even more of an incentive uh we actually just launched another build with Claud contest yesterday it runs until July 10th the top three projects will each receive 10K in anthropic API credits to see more details just visit that link below it's just at the top of our docs page as well so you can find it there too I'll leave that up for a second and finally if you have any questions or you want to hear more about just what we're thinking about uh I'll be at that AWS Booth down the hall for the next few hours you can also find me on X Twitter Alex Alber with2 unor um I do try to read all my DMs I spend way too much time on that site so feel free to ask questions there as well and with that I want to say thank you guys very much and enjoy the uh last day of the summit [Music]
