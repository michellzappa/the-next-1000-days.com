thank you Mary for the nice introduction thanks everyone for attending this web uh webinar my presentation is about how under when AI going to augment employee creativity my name is Shamy new from Temple where I have a global Institute for AI and business analytics Center uh this work uh is joined work with nine 10 and the 10 10 now at this moment probably every one of us will not be surprised that AI like algorithm robots can boost employees efficiency by efficiency we mean that um because AI can find the Big Data hidden patterns um and they can retrieve the right answers to the work more efficiently so efficiency def is higher now um now we can to ask a different question which is can AI increase employees creativity so by creativity here we means going to have a new and useful solution to customer problems this would be uh an interesting angle because the prior research or prior topic has been focused on how AI can replace human workers so here we're going to say how AI augment human intelligence if the AI assistance can help employee create uh increase their creativity find a new and useful solution that would be a good news for a Workforce and for companies so how we go test or answer this research question we conduct a field experiment uh at the setting is a large high-tech teic marketing company basically they have a huge call center they serve over 10 million customers uh so you can imagine customer service cost and outbound sales cost um what's the AI technology here so we all um really interested in gen AI technology um you can think about this is AI chatbot uh where it's a combination of CH GPD which generate languages um and plus voice technology so you have a text to speech speech to text technology combined with the GPD now uh the training data for this AI chat B is more than 10 terabytes of C Center data so they have the correct answers positive samples negative samples in terms of how to serve the customers in the right way and the algorithms are basically deep learning Neo networks plus reinforced learning uh this technology has passed the T test for a short conversation with the customer like in less than two or three minutes um for those settings so in the experiment what we did is we randomized over 3,100 customers uh into different experiment conditions now because this AI Chapo technology has passed the tourin test so they can serve customers in the call center so the company can send either AI techology or humans to serve customers so the setting here is about a outbound sales call uh company want reach out to the customers to purchase a new credit card so the AI technology where introduced previous night and then we have could be also could be have top agents bought human agents so they can do two tasks the first task is about need generation so basically call customer marry are you interested in this product I going to give you discount and coupon or other promotion deals so we call the sales need generation the goal is trying to confirm customer interest So This is highly script repetitive task where AI can learn a pattern so AI can handle this work or human can do it too in the second stage is about sales persuasion so after confirm customers needs these customers will want to convert their interest into purchase so from sales needs to purchasers this kind of persuation has is more um most of them are on script where could it be outside the knowledge Bank um AI has not been learn so we need human agents to convert uh customers interest into purchase so you have combination for combinations uh the experiment condition so the key task is about creativity that's going to be our dependent variable outcome variable how we measure that and so we Define that as a novel and useful solutions to customer problems so we're going to use voice regulation and text mining techniques to determine whether the customer's question uh in the sales call is outside knowledge bank so if it's within knowledge bank and that's not going to be part of the creativity answers from the employee so what we're going to do is we're going to do look at the outside of large Bank question from customers those would be untrained no scripts so for example in our setting um customers going to ask can I use the the new product which is credit card for the down payment of buying the house so that's going to be a typical uh question from customers we call the cross domain um so that we're going to be need um useful and lavel answers from the employees so we're going to determing this uh creativity measurement could be determined by experience managers uh a final measure is a ratio of untrained question that was successfully answered by the employee to the questions asked by customers so that must be novel and useful to qualify as a creativity outcome so the results uh on my left bar is Agent with bys so without AI assistant help you can see with the AI assistance there are 2.3 times increase in the uh creativity of human workers um then we look at the hyro hydrogenated we find that um we have four bars on the right is the bottom agents with n skilled uh employees now a little bit increase in their creativity as well but a large increase confer top agents then uh what's the mechanism why the AI systems have such asymmetric uh bandad for the top agents um so we conduct uh in-depth interviews with the employees in the experiment uh we find that when the AI handles boring repetitive jobs that's basically outbound sales call to customer marry to ask her interest do you like this product do you take this deal so this a really repetitive task uh if you get rid of that that the AI handles that the employees can you have more free time and the stronger interest and motivation they feel much better better mood better morale even the pride uh is higher and have more energy obviously right because they have more mental power now to think about Creative Solutions to customer problems uh this benefits is going to be more for top employees because they have more skills uh to think about creative solution after they have more free time mental power they can do so even more relatively lower skilled agents some interview turns out the lower skilled agents they feel higher work pressure and even noer more R because they they feel like technology AI is so powerful so Advanced now and they feel threatened of the job security as well um it's not surprising like if you look at the creativity and the uh performance of the employees of course there's a positive correlation right higher productivity higher performance so the AI assistance can really turn um into double benefits like employees creativity is higher and or performance will be lift up as well now in conclusion um we think this research is exciting in the context that prior topic is really we think about AI replace human we feel threatened um that AI human timately intelligent Is On The Rise um but the key is we're going to do the job design differently n AI handle the script repetitive task uh and then humans going do do those creative work um so humans we do not like repetitive boring Works they suck about energy Elemental time um especially top employees they would like to have more you know work freedom so that they can create new and useful solutions for old problems now manager implications uh we think this AI going to going to alter uh job roles basically employees think about what's the future what's the roles they play in um in handling customer service problem for example and the company should design AI human teams to capture this value from this complimentarity uh between Ai and the human uh skills uh the one caveat is company should be mindful um of what kind of employee to pair with AI so we find that when AI paired with top agents their creativity is much much higher and both the company's performance and the workers welfare the creativity will be much higher so that's it thank you for your attention thank you so much streaming I I just I I'll I'll save some questions for but just as a quick takeaway I think that what is so really very important from your research is this um fact that uh AI can really improve the work Freedom that you said I like that term that you use for for uh humans and that you really really present a a um a best practice which is for companies to start with these AI human teams with their top agents first like don't implement it across all employees but really with those top agents because they have the most to gain from it but also the the organization has the most to learn from it because you did point out how it the lower skilled workers have so much anxiety this could create more anxiety and so hopefully maybe these top teams could really help with you know as they upskill some of these lower employees or not lower but lower skilled employees or not as talented employees or they just haven't been on the job as much it shouldn't be a derogatory term we maybe have to think of a different term for that but um what what do you do you agree with that kind of assumption that that's almost a best practice to start with these high skilled workers yeah so I think one of the key takeaway uh in terms of this context the hydrogen between the top and the bottom workers right uh so companies always need higher rookies right that's uh that's for ret customer for the employee retention new Workforce those are natural process so company always have a lower skill workers and hopefully they can learn more and learn faster at a job so the AI coach can do this kind of job as well the as you're saying the key task is upscale or retraining for different purpose and another B way I think related to that would be the company should be clearly communicating what's the intended use of AI right so noer skills always feel threatened they feel like a company rolling out the technology and they going to name them off right but in this context the company should also communicate that we can use the technology to help you to give you job recommendations to how to serve customer better in this context um and then and in that NE employees can feel like well okay the compan is are trying to help me out rather than really like lay me off and for the long term right so do they see the intended use of the AI is trying to save their time time and energy and then after retraining upscale and then they're going to feel the companies taking care of them so that's um part of uh that minero takeway that that all the messaging what I'm really taking away too is the messaging of how they use this with their employees and just such I can't wait to talk more about this but what we're going to do now is we're going to turn it over to Emma Wilds um and Emma take it away okay um thank you so much I'm very happy to be here my name is Emma WS uh I'm going to be talking today about the role of a AI in hiring and in the sort of the hiring process and matching um and specifically about the informational role of the job resume so in recent years more and more of sort of job search and hiring is happening online between job boards like monster and indeed and online labor markets like Fiverr and upwork these sorts of online marketplaces mediating these transaction are getting a tremendous amount of data on job Seekers and employers and so platforms have been using machine learning tools to improve and increase the quantity and quality of matches between employers and workers and a lot of of research has focused on how platforms can use this data to decrease search frictions usually with features like um recommendation systems but platforms are not the only ones who can use AI tools so job Seekers and employes ERS can use new language models to spruce up or even entirely write application materials and how the matching process changes when users use algorithmic approaches to better present themselves to the market is a sort of more recent phenomenon and kind of understudied question and so today I'm going to share results from an experiment where we randomly assign new job Seekers to an online labor market to have their resumés spruced up by AI so when we think about the implications of someone using AI on their application materials it's most important if employers actually care about writing quality um and so the first thing we I want to show is that they do um if you look at about uh you know 200,000 résumés on an online labor market prior to the experiment we ran and count the rating errors in each resume you can see job Seekers with higher error rates are much less likely to be hired and so okay if maybe we think that writing quality and hiring are correlated um we don't know why that would be we don't know if it's just correlation or if there's a causal reason this is happening and so if we think through sort of what a non-causal story would be for why there is this correlation you could imagine that maybe employers don't actually care about the writing on application materials or on resumés um but better workers have to be better writers and so we're just picking up in the data that the better writers are more likely to be hired because those are just the better workers but it's also possible that this relationship is causal and that employers would rather hire workers who who are better writers and so there's a couple different reasons this could be happening um and we're going to try and disentangle that in this paper so the first one what we call the signaling view is that writing ability is a signal of diligence or attention to detail or something about the underlying workers quality or type and um another view that we we uh propose and and end up showing evidence for is called what we're calling the clarity view which is that good writing has no relationship with the workers underlying quality but um a well-written resume basically helps employers to understand what it is the job Seeker is proposing or what their skills are or how go a fit they are and so allows them to be in the consideration set at all and so you know our the sort of two big research questions are can algorithmically enhanced writing improve hiring outcomes for job Seekers and if so how useful is writing quality as a signal of worker ability uh and luckily these questions are testable and so we're going to investigate them in the setting of a large online labor market this is uh a sort of an online labor market that looks very similar to to offline labor markets in many ways um but all the work is done online and crucially both the employers and the workers rate each other at the end of every um job and so if we want to then test these hypotheses what we can do is on this uh on this online labor market is we we s we randomize right in quality and what we the way we do that is for new entrance to the market new job Seekers who are signing up who are you know their resumés we provide them with a a piece of software that is a language model this is prior to generative AI this is you know in early 2021 so it's not generative it's not prompted but it's an AI tool that improves your writing without you know writing you an entire resume from for you so we provide the treatment group in this experiment uh this this tool to to help with write their resume and the controller we don't and then we can observe whether or not the treated group is more likely to be hired see if the better writers despite being no better workers get hired to find out if employers actually care about writing quality and then what we're going to do to disentangle the signaling View and the clarity view is to look at measures of employer satisfaction so the reason we're doing this is that if workers with better writing are more likely to be hired despite being no better workers the signaling view would predict that employers are going to be disappointed with the quality of work that they do because in essence they've been tricked into hiring worse workers so that we can we can see our our employers disappointed if the clarity view is true the treatment then simply allows workers to more clearly describe their skills background and fit and so we're going to look at a bunch of measures of employer satisfaction to sort of try to untangle these two views the measures of employer satisfaction we look at are like whether or not they're uh the the treated workers are ever rehired um how many hours they work as well as you know all the sorts of ratings they get and then we do some you know natural language processing and sentiment analysis on the the written text of the reviews they get as well and so what we find is that treated workers are 8% more likely to be hired so employers do care about writing quality um and we also find a bunch of evidence for the uh Clarity view so we find more productive workers are the ones that get hired and that treated workers employers are no less satisfied with the work that they that is done um and so this is evidence for the clarity view this is like a very nice story about the use of of AI on an online labor market um and so maybe what we should do is we should make it so that everyone uses some sort of AI tool when they write their resumés and it will just you know it'll increase the demand for labor people will hire more um but crucially these results are very likely to attenuate if you roll this out platform wide so what I'm doing here is I look at the the effect of the treatment um by the sort of amount that a worker is in competition with workers in the treatment group so on the left side of the graph we have people who basically are applying for jobs where there's no one else in the treatment group applying for them so they're the only one with this kind of benefit of of a slightly better written resume and on the right it's ones who compete with a lot of workers in the treatment group so maybe half of the people in their um who have applied for the job that they apply for half of them also have the treatment and what we find is that the treatment effect is really it's really isolated down if you have you have to have kind of very little competition from other people with this as well for the treatment effect to uh be significant and so this suggests that you know it is probably not the case that uh if if a like if a platform or a labor market rolls you know gives everyone AI on their resume that you're going to get way more highers than you would have otherwise which is kind of intuitive um that being said because it it m it um it causes the workers that hired to be more productive there are still benefits of doing it but it's going to increase kind of the quality of the matches uh as opposed to the quantity of them overall and so this is very I think this is important because writing is used to evaluate ability in like every aspect of life work school essays um writing samples cover letters and as AI enhanced or generated writing materials become more common writing is likely to become an even less reliable signal of ability and as become more common the benefits of using them are going to decrease um and so for platforms this is important to know how how the the use of these tools impacts the informational value of the content on their sites and platforms need to know if providing users access to AI is is going to really increase their engagement and if these effects are going to um hold as they become ubiquitous thank you very much thank you very much Emma um fascinating fascinating to know something that we've always um relied on is our is our written word yeah how much uh the large language models have affected that and um how that's been a benefit to employees or job Seekers I should say because they're not employees yet not yet yeah um but they they they you know feel like they might have an upper hand because for a while there you know there was algorithms um seeking them to uh to to not be able to apply because they just couldn't want you know they just couldn't get to that right those right words that are necessary to get through the algorithm algorithms now they have they feel like there's a Level Playing Field but now those employers are going to really need to determine what is are we getting the skill sets that we really want and we can't wait as heavily that screening tool that we had right and so I think in this in this setting it allows people who were sort of very high quality workers but couldn't maybe their English wasn't as good or for whatever reason they're not very good writers and they can't kind of show that they're good workers and so those people were kind of getting ignored and if you use these kinds of tools to just like help um improve the improve their writing a little bit it can it can their skills more obvious I see a question types of screening tools and writing tools so um this is like the the algorithmic writing assistance that I'm talking about here is it's something that you know you put in a paragraph of text and then it underlines uh you know a phrase and it says like replace this phrase with something better and it suggests the exact phrase you should replace it with um it will both point out errors and it suggests kind of better phrasing or it'll say this isn't very clear or this is repetitive that kind of thing and so you're just getting these kind of highlighted underlined uh underlined things and then you get these suggestions that you can replace it with so it's not like you put your resume into chatu it's not like you say chat PT write me your resume um and I think that the results are likely to be very different if the tool was chachu BT here it is very clear that you know this tool is taking text you have already written that is going to have um you know some amount of your voices it there's going to potentially be some informational value in it and it's just kind of tweaking it's just tweaking um and it's making you sort of look better on the margin and it's it's making you look good enough that people are more likely to hire you but it's not like if you were to just say Chachi BT write me a resume and then as an employer you're looking at this resume and you're like I this is like I get nothing from this resume it just says a list of bullet points that says you know oh you have good communication skills work well in teams attention to detail you know you see all those things and you're like I'm not getting any information out of it so I think these results are very likely to be different if you use generative Ai and I have future work that has shown that the results are very different you part two yeah part two uh for for the next for the conference in the spring all right we'll go over to um Cedric yeah for um uh his topic on uh on uh generative Ai and in the labor online labor market Cedric um you're on thank you thank you let me share the screen okay uh hello everyone uh thank you for having me I'm Cedric I'm a thiry year PhD at udub so I'm glad to share my work briefly and have the opportunity to learn from anyone everyone uh on this topic uh this is a joint work with Jing Professor Lee and Professor tan so okay we all know that um labor exchange is a pivotal component of our soci Society so individuals on the um supply side contributed their time energy and their services for which they will receive some salaries and acknowledgement so on the other hand entities on the labor demand side can consume the products or Services directly or they can circulate them on the market afterward so nowadays the gig economy is becoming a big player in this uh labor economy so this trending was also strengthened during and after the pandemic now people are gradually getting used to fulfilling their labor demands by finding someone online and people are also gradually adapting to the work from home or work from anywhere environment so anyone who has some flexible time can contribute to the gig economy um but things are changing especially after the generative AI so as you can see in November 20 20 22 um CH GPT is launched and it can be regarded as one of the first generation of AGI so by AGI I mean that it has good performance on some complicated complicated tasks so we can do coding and proof reading with it and maybe it is not better than all the human experts but it's kind of comparable to some human and secondly it is general purpose meaning that um like previous Technologies even at a superhuman level such as afar fold or alar zero they are tailored to specific tasks but for chat gbt and other Technologies they are like a general purpose they can be done they can be used to do many tasks maybe even beyond the designer's expectations so this kind of bring more complexity and opportunities into this fute uh the third thing is that it's easily accessible to everyone so basically if I don't have any Tech any PR prior knowledge on programming I can still use it to finish my tasks so all of these attributes for generative AI kind of bring more challenges and opportunities to the online labor markets and the labor market at large so in fact there is some existing evidence some suggestive evidence about how labor markets are affected for example uh like AI is basically killing check and other online tutoring platforms we can see the stock price has gone all the way down and we can also see that freelancer.com is getting less much less attention over time so in the past maybe it's fluctuating around some level maybe 25 in the Google Trends but now it's much lower so there is a clear maybe substitution uh happening out there but we are we don't know how exactly it works therefore we conducted This research and we are mainly focusing on how Chad gbt is affecting the both the labor demand and the supply in the gig economy platforms and we we are also show some uh suggestive evidence about uh how workers are adapting to this trend so first thing I want to summarize is that some Market level impact so basically we actually have two data sets uh the First Data s is more um client Centric so the clients can post their demands on the labor market and then the Freelancers will build for them afterward the clients will uh select one freelancer or just select no nobody to fulfill their demand and the match is formed so people can exchange their service and the salary and for this Market we kind of show all of these uh results the first thing is on the demand side basically we show that uh a clear like substitution effect on the tax and the programming jobs so there are fewer clients who post a fewer jobs on the market and the remaining jobs seem to be more complicated because they require higher budgets as for the labor supply side um as uh of course we uh we may suspect that um generate AI enable more people to accomplish some task s but as we can see uh the labor Supply is also shrinking so fewer people are bidding on jobs on the market as a result the like actually the competition is actually intensified because uh the average bids for each project is actually increasing so this is like the market level impact for generative AI um it's like a overall Market shrinking process but we also show some um exciting points for Freelancers so for the second data set we are it is more freelancer Centric so for that platform people Freelancers are actually posting their services available for other people and the worker clients can go to the market and ask the Freelancers to fulfill their demand and uh like a transaction happen so for this platform we kind of identify several Freelancers who are embracing AI so they are creating jobs related to J gbt and we can see they are benefiting more from this process so they get more transactions over time compared with other people so there's a clear opportunity as well to sum up uh we can see like although the market for existing job is shrinking and the Freelancers have to adapt to this trend quickly and provide some compliment Services we can see clear opportunities and maybe our more suggestion is that for the big economy platform and for the policy makers we have to provide some related resources for them so that they can kind of adapt to this trend and everyone can be more happier much happier over time so yeah this is uh the main points I want to share today so yeah thank you thank you so much three very very interesting uh talks here um before we uh I do I kind of open it up to all three of you Cedric I want to give one specifically um to you and when we talk about the freelance Market I think it would be good for everyone on um the webinar to understand potentially can you can you speak more specifically to a freelancer that would be using chat GPT I mean the one that comes to mind for me would be a writer that more that would use it more effectively but I I was just wonder maybe you could just elaborate on that maybe in one area of freelancing that had would you know adapt uh chat GPT more readily yeah like for adapting adopting chat gbt I think um we have to be more uh cautious about what kind of jobs we are do in the future so for example we want to do some jobs that are not easily substituted by AI or some jobs that can complement complement AIS so like this is like a challenge uh like there are challenges and opportunities for Freelancers so first first of for some existing demand are replacing by AI so we are just not just competing with other Freelancers we're also competing with AI and secondly but other people can use AI so we are also competing with maybe human plus AI but for the second point we are also have some opportunities because we can use it on our own maybe shaming talk is a good starting point we can use it creatively and uh we can use it to argument our skills for example for proof reading uh maybe in the future we don't want to just do proof reading because it can be done uh by AI easily but we can be more creative writing some like Po poems or Etc so it's like involves human elements um yeah okay and then I noticed in the chat um someone mentioned like front-end developers you know that that ones that use AI much more effectively the front end developers can be that much more valuable in the gig economy that really see how they can use that um Ai and I'm going to ask everyone on the webinar um to put all of your questions not in the chat but at the bottom of the screen you should see something that says Q&A if you could put all of your questions in there that's where we'll be um we have that open and we'll be looking at that and you can also vote on those questions as well so to um so thank you everyone I'm going to start out with a some question questions for each of our um our guests and then we're going to go into our Q&A questions um and first I'd like to start with Shing Ming uh you know if AI can boost production efficiency and uh creativity in the workplace as you demonstrated how will you know the expectations of employees change in terms of you know the metrics that they are measured on and you know and then essentially how are employers going to message to those employees that they're going to be evaluated on higher productivity outcomes without creating you know this anxiety because that's where I really see this all moving towards is there's this expectation of efficiency and creativity and there's going to be new metrics and you know how are we not going to create that that type of anxiety and how are they going to Pivot to that yeah so this a very per uh pertinent question and a very German question and important at a workplace in the for the future work Mary so I think this the exciting part and the dangerous part coexist right so the the dangerous part we already heard a lot of these stories and replace displace humans workers uh I think I want to be on the exciting part the story we want to tell in this paper is really from mon to create it right so the boring repetitive part of work not the AI handle they they're good at it they can make a nest error compared to human because it's repetitive they know the answers they just retrieve the answers from knowledge bank right so I think the job design the expectation for employees should be changed uh by managers or CEOs when we design this work or job roles so if it's simple repetitive questions such just for example in our setting is conf firm you know the customer Mary or Emma are you interested in this product or not right those stuff you don't need really a high Talent people a worker to do that 1,000 times right because like 90% of the people Cod to call they're not going to buy you anything from you right that's a code call I'm not in the market so NE AI to do those boring repetitive time consuming work um so the expectation could be set up differently so the job design uh could to be differently workflow differently at the company and the managers should be communicating this to different type of workers right you holding the high the top talents for Creative Solutions Department the hire skills not smile delivery right so this will be uh for hiring is the same thing so for the hiring you need the HR manager the senior HR manager to deal with the most tough difficult hire right and then there no task uh then you can use the AI to screening these job applicants because AI can can know you just give the threshold some certain rules characteristics they can stick to the puristic the rules as as Fair transparent for hiring they can do much better now no bias to stick to those rules right human decide those rules now the really tricky part the dangerous part is the lower skill ones because they're just higher they're rookie they need time to develop and then that's where we can have build this AI human team now in the future in my H vision would be this AI once they learn the knowledge bank they can help train this lower skill workers and that's another efficiency company can leverage right so because the company is once you free the employees time then you can give a new business right so you can start a new sector New Vertical you can spin out for other business once you have these talents so it's it in the long term would not be a sustainable strategy just na off all your employees right because it depends on AI or it comes to Super AI I think you still need some um elements or the human capital in your company to serve for the right purpose so it's different strategy for different type of employees in that education and Fring and the support um I think that's the key the exciting part again in summary is just to be design your your job role differently with the technology that would leverage the AI human complimentarity well for both for the employee side and for the organization side yes very very I mean wow there was a lot of information I think we'll all take away from that and one of the key points too that I uh when you were speaking I just was I mean I know everyone's like oh this is the you know the AE new age New Dawn you know it's like the age of the internet but and I know we can compare it to I mean different it's like when the internet St first came but when you were describing it I was also thinking that it's it's it's you know with our Industrial Revolution and Henry Ford and how he you know figured out the assembly line what you just stated is this is like the assembly line of knowledge tasks and that these more boring tasks that's what a company really needs to look at in terms everyone's looking for use cases like how do I use Ai and in in essence you have given them a formula and say look at your most boring task this is where AI can enrich your company from a productivity standpoint but also in a in an employee retention standpoint and how to you know make the the the Investments you make in your employees that much better now not only from a you know a pay standpoint but also from their their their own productivity so I really appreciate how you you know you all everything you shared with us can relate to all that and we have a couple other questions that I want to um share with Emma and and Cedric as well and um there's one that uh specifically for uh Cedric that we we talked about early uh early on and that is you know we're at this um pivoted point of of llms in the gig economy and the fact the gig economy didn't even exist a couple years ago and here it is and now we have another disruption to that to that PO you know that potential Workforce so could you explore or let us know what the distinctive features are of possibly llm specifically like generative Ai and you you know how does that contrast to like previous Technologies and and its impact on the workforce um you know compared to like tools that used to happen like Google Translate was huge when that first came out so maybe you could explain this disruption of an llm within like that gig economy and and what people should really look towards um um doing in that yeah thank you for the question uh I also notice like a question in the chat about uh how we should exactly develop uh in the pH in the age of AI so yeah um the first thing I want to mention is that it's general purpose and there are some emergence ability of AI so basically uh designers cannot ex expect what people can use it to do uh so we can be more creative about we we can do in the future um this is kind of very different from Google Translation and the second is thing is that it's easy to use so in the P we have bird and other various strong models but it kind of require some uh prior knowledge to use them and now with chat gbt everyone can do do at least some coding so I think that's another difference as for uh Freelancers I think we can or maybe ordinary workers um I think we can categorize the jobs to several categories the first thing is that it's entirely replaced by AI so it doesn't exist anymore the second part is that uh it's complemented by AI so it lowers the bar for an ordinary people to uh ordinary person to join the Labor uh Supply it and the Third Kind is that the jobs cannot be done by human only or AI only so I I suggest like people can like adopt a second and a third Trend and uh another thing I want to mention that because Technologies are evolving and this is a time for human co-evolve with AI so uh I think mindset is more important than specific skills so instead of building some skills and expect that it won't be replaced anymore in the future and I think it's more important to have a lifetime learner attitude so maybe when new technologies come I can adapt to that okay thank you that was that was very comp um complete too um Emma what you know so we we have had the both these different um perspectives here and how things are you know a we know AI is a disruptor and um you know we've talked about employees how they can you know where they're going to be um you know upskilling and how employers have to work with that and you know when different economies you know how AI is you know either going to you know bring in new a new econ maybe a new economy uh or labor market but for for what you were speaking to how as the individual is applying for the jobs because still we have to apply for a job whether it's in a gig economy or more of a formal setting so there's these we we're applying and then we have employers deciding to hire us so how is generative AI chat GPT llms how is that going to change that process of applying and then hiring in its in the biggest sense that you see like you know 18 months out yeah I I think that you know when you think about the sort of screening process that employers normally do they're taking a lot of written material making judgments on it and then like maybe maybe you do interviews um my guess is that cover letters which are already I think not taken extremely seriously are going to just fade uh do a slow Fade Out and that things like interviews are going to become a lot more important and um I think that that's I think we've kind of already we already kind of can see that happening like cover letters used to be a very big deal and people already will be like I don't read the cover letter so I think uh that is the easiest thing to have a generative AI do for you is write you a cover letter like it can do that in you know with one prompt um and so my guess is that as we're seeing that you know more and more people are adopting these tools uh employers are going to probably emphasize the like the interview step of the process and you know you could also imagine not just interviews but like especially in technical jobs they already are you know they already have have steps of the process where you have to you know do tasks so that could be uh that could become more important as well although like that can still be influenced by by AI like I've seen examples of people doing Amazon interviews in some language they've never coded in and then they you know in real time are like zooming with someone who's telling them to do something in code and they're like looking it up on Chacha BT or you know and uh and doing it so it's it's going to be very hard to completely you know remove generative AI from the equation and I don't think we need to completely remove it from the equation we just need to sort of figure out what are the parts of the hiring process where you're getting the most information about applicants like quality and and um and fit for whatever job it is and emphasize those okay great I think you in our chat here we see people that are saying that this cover uh that cover letters are the best hack I didn't finished what they said but they mentioned that I think they concurred with you here we are experiences of the cover letterers are the best back in today's job market gen does a neat job on the draft but complete autogenerated covers are not good enough okay um I I think one I interesting question that's just more like zooming out a bit um it for all of you and any one of you can take this is they were what people I thought this was from Dana and she said what are the regional differences we could potentially observe meaning maybe continents or or regions maybe you know uh that um might occur based on how how chat how generative um large language models are applied and accepted I mean I guess one is who's using them but then also on the flip side the employers or the government or just the the society how what their acceptance is of that um so anyone want to um in in the realm of the workforce does anyone want to take that yeah I can take a quick uh uh about the education application for example uh because of large online um free programs or course teaching right if have a specific topic like machine learning AI knowledge you can take some free course online so those are a lot of things available now with this AI technology generally they do pretty good on structured knowledge education so what's the role of future professors for example for us right so for example if you're advising PhD students that's a different equation right because that's not a mass education so if there's a structur ni we call the knowledge Bank Knowledge Graph as long as you have the knowledge graph set up the a can do those can uh then we call repetitive task then let the AI to do it then free our professor's time in doing those High creativity more challenging part of work and advice and teach students uh and honors students to do some really meaningful pro-social pro- environment those kind of like emerging topics very important um so I think that human capital development is really really critical and the AI can help us Educators to do those basic uh you know work and then the higher level work and then always you need a human expertise to do that I think we mentioned HR application is the same thing there's not a company nowadays Fortune Fortune 500 companies they use AI to screen job applicant 80% of job applicants are not fitting that job basically HR they not even uh you know should not reach to the HR manager office at all right we know that that's happen at PNG you R all these big companies uh car companies you can you can see those industry verticals and another applications healthc care we know that AI assistance can help doing nursing role like as a nurse uh and the collect the vitals get your your past medical history that's very accurate and they can they can build that knowledge uh very comp uh fast the time efficiency and the quality is very good but we still need a doctor human doctor so as the audience one of the comments is I see a lot of future opportunities in terms of hii human AI team so just incrementally that AI take this like a like a food chain right the value team let take this step by step and then the human's time will fear more and more for higher order more challenging task very exciting very yeah I'm gonna have to we're gonna have to wrap it up because we're actually at time so um but what a way to end that you know it's I like that you know there there's there's the calmness of the step by-step I mean there's a lot of disruption but step by step and there's always humans that are going to be involved in this and embracing on how we can use the AI for many repetitive tasks but also to enhance our creativity with our jobs there's going to be change out there and it's exciting so I you know hope to see you all again soon thank you to everyone who's joined please tune in um March 1st for our next um AI Horizon's webinar on Innovation um we will be sending out this uh recording um and references to the authors um the presenters papers and their slides but once again thank you Cedric Emma and Shing for joining me today everyone have a great Friday thank you so very much
