like what that's wild like real yeah I mean your eyes are close your there too much teeth I think I don't know um I want to make a review come help me all right sounds good all right meet you downstairs all right if you want like a normal review of this thing I can't recommend enough to go watch to go watch Marquez brownley his is fantastic this is a different like I kind of have a different take on this and different questions and that's what this is but Marquez is really good what is this thing that I'm holding literally you how do you find it I've had it for like an hour yeah okay can you put Windows up now if you want yeah so like I can put a window up now but when I start walking they like go away they fade away cool enjoy take care all right [Music] too you get a random pile of bricks an old toilet I found the restroom and a bunch of random wooden poles there's more poles hi let's pile on that boat and leave and as you can see but later in this video we're going to aund and also super Island but furnace we're going to head over to strategy for interacting with people they Gaslight you into thinking so if you're moving a lot while you're moving this thing comes up that says tracking fail so it doesn't track if you're moving a lot says nothing for the sensors to like lock on to it doesn't know where to put stuff but standing at a subway stop watching a Mr be video is a pretty special it's a pretty special experience hold on Jordan let me try to figure out how do I what do you think it's interesting I I can't imagine I can't imagine why you're looking at uh I'm looking at you right now oh okay I can see you clear as day you got on a blue tie with a beautiful tie pin at the top so I can see you I get off here enjoy your adventure bye-bye uh I opened up Apple TV and it was like this window right here de Jordan and as he started to move the window went away with the back with the subway car you can't use Windows if you're in like a if there's a lot of like kinetic movement it I imagine it works in an airplane cuz the airplane is so steady but this is a Subway and it's bouncing so I got to wait till we get [Music] there I thisen tether to my iPhone it seems to be working well enough but for some reason when I try to open Safari it won't [Music] open I was just responding to text [Music] messages no way you're the only person I wanted to be in case wait is it case I can't tell did you not tell no way like oh my God no way I'm actually freak the idea that I could have my whole like computer digital online world that exists in the real world that's what that's what feels like is bigger than AR or VR like I have the Oculus it's great but it definitely feels like a toy this feels like a little glimpse into the future of what Computing could be like down the road why is everybody staring at me do I look as ridiculous as those people make me feel like I look no you're just your eyes are glowing how you doing Jord you're standing right in front of my Mr Beast video come right there okay years ago this used to be a bar yep yeah you want to walk under this so the idea of spatial Computing it doesn't make sense to me when I'm sitting in my office I've got multiple streams but right now I'm like in the city I'm in the middle of Time Square I've got my virtual keyboard here I've got Apple TV there I got YouTube safaris open in here and it all kind of works like this what I've got going on right now this is wild it's impossible for me to imagine that you can't see what I can see everything seems so real and then I can just stand up what up man [Music] guys are done it thank you next guest [Music] next [Music] the butterfly is eating my donut the concept for this video was to run around New York City wearing these cuz I thought that would be funny I think it was funny but something happened something happened today that was completely unexpected and that's something I don't think anyone else has really touched on none of the reviews I've seen or read none of them really put to words what I experienced so when you take these off they kind of go to sleep like your phone and when you put them back on you have to unlock them they scan your eyeballs and then to start screen recording go through the it takes a second so rather than doing that I just left these on the entire day um the like 2 and 1/2 hour battery pack you can plug into a fatter batteries so I never ran out of battery power and after a couple of hours of running around the streets of New York as did not in a controlled environment my brain sort of clicked and it just forgot that I was looking through cameras and screens and it just it it took what it saw as reality and that is where this this that's where the that profound moment came from and what occurred to me as I was sitting there in Time Square on a bench strangers all around me the real world moving all around me but I had like a big screen up where I was watching a Mr Beast video and then over here I had this keyboard that I could interact with and over here I had my iMessages and over here I had my Apple TV and then all my apps and they're floating in Time Square in the middle of New York City they're floating there and I'm actually there and there's actual humans around me and in that moment I was like holy this is it this is the future of computing that everyone's been promising for like the last 15 years this is something that like let me like truly Peak into where we're where all of this is going this isn't the like the future of AR or VR this is the I think this is the future interface for all Computing I think when they figure out how to make these na be these heavy $4,000 metal ski goggles but you know maybe they look like these glasses or something even smaller that that is what it'll be in the morning you won't remember your phone you put it on and then that's it and it's like hold on I've got a call hey what's up Mom I'll call you back you look great by the way and that's what it's going to look like and these show you that these reveal that I'm like as a geek that was the thing I've been looking for forever and they did it right here on a product that has like a product that is so new this has been out for 12 hours and I felt it so I don't know that I recommend you should buy one of these at $4,000 because I can promise you this this will be the worst Vision Pro Apple ever ships it is going to get so much better all right and maybe I'll make another video that that's that that makes more sense of this [Music] but in summary by Apple stock cuz this is without a doubt a new product category that they will see through
