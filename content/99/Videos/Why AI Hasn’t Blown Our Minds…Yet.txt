hypothetically if AI is a bust in a bunch of different ways but it works extremely well fixing customer service that's still massive going to change our world massive [Music] impact hello this is Dalton plus Michael and today we're going to talk about why isn't AI knocking our socks off where's the AI Revolution where's I was told this is a revolutionary product and I saw that Google thing and Google's demo was bad and where is my Surplus economy like aren't we supposed to be in Star Trek World by now why do I have to still work like what's going on D yeah one funny thing about hype Cycles is there's always going to be two sides of the debate which is this thing is overhyped and this thing is underhyped yes you don't get many clicks arguing this is exactly the right amount of hype subtly perfectly hyped yeah this is perfect so you you always have like two sides of it I think one of the AI is overhyped arguments is just the demos may be cool when you see the vid the launch videos but the products themselves are kind of crappy and not being deployed in production they're not being deployed in ways that touch lots of consumers I try to say a different way I don't pick up my phone and use an AI product multiple times a day in the same way that like other products I've adopted yeah the perfect example Google right it's just like Google search happened and I found myself using it without prompt yep I haven't had that moment yet I guess the argument that I would make on this is that the lwh hanging fruit use cases are going to be fixed first and those are not likely to be the use cases that are the knock your socks off consumer oh my God I'm living in in the futuristic dream world um I think the one I would talk about first that I think is happening already is the following have you ever tried to talk to Xfinity cast or Verizon Wireless or United Airlines United Airlines yes um those experiences are uniquely bad yes and known to be bad and are you know just bad always just bad it's just bad and you go into them knowing it's going to be bad and then somehow this this is impressively bad and it seems like one of the first use cases that AI is being implemented is to improve customer support in various ways yes we are already seen a lot of this being deployed in real use cases and what it's competing with is something that is so bad yeah yeah um AI makes it better I think the other reason we're not hearing about this maybe as much as you would think is if you're actually deploying AI to these use cases there's a few reasons you wouldn't want to beat your chest and be proud of it and talk about it a few of which are just like you know people jobs people are worried about their jobs also you don't want to get embarrassed like Google did of all this bad press they put something out and they got embarrassed because the the chat bot did embarrassing things and so I think there's a lot of Secret customer service AI things that are out there doing real stuff well another thing with customer service it for most consumers it's not a DA thing that's right like hopefully you're not calling customer service every day so you don't see it like you see other consumer products and so I think it's already being deployed I think there'll be more of it uh deployed I think it's going to revolutionize be good it's going to revolutionize things and these are not small Industries sometimes I'll talk to people like oh yeah customer service cool what else and I'll be like wait hold on yeah this is a really part of the GDP of the world is people that do customer service or try to interact uh in these service level jobs so this alone yes hypothetically if AI is a bust in a bunch of different ways but it works extremely well fixing customer service that's still profly going to change our world massive impact that's a great example obviously um if you're a developer I would argue that you're having a different experience than the experience I described um between using AI products help you code using something like co-pilot yeah everyone uses co-pilot right like the the numbers that I've heard are crazy what percentage of programmers use Coop and it's actually interesting to me because unlike Google where I would say that I saw developers and non-developers kind of equally have overwhelming usage there's actually a very clear divide where it's like developers can use something like chat gbt way more often and generate way more value with it than normal consumers can Y and so this is another area where of course making developers more productive would have profound impact yeah on the world it won't knock your socks off if you're a consumer out there you'll be like okay you're boring me dalon and Michael I don't care but if you're a programmer and you you now have this new tool you didn't have in the past you're using every single day to do your job that is a profound Improvement big big big deal and then I mean obviously you know internet research right like just the finding information and this is one where I've seen it with my kid like I realize you know as a grizzled 41-year-old I'm just like not actively seeking out information at the same rate that my six-year-old child is you know you have a young child like you know just like they can ask a question about everything once every 10 seconds for their whole weeking time and products like this that can just answer every single question like the best encyclopedia and dictionary that ever existed that that's useful to a six-year-old again we have that so I think people are already being desensitized like yeah yeah yeah whatever cool like I get it but when is it going to be really good it's like hey this is already pretty useful yes pretty pretty good what's interesting is you see those use cases and you still though have to acknowledge people have this feeling and specifically I think the feeling that they have I've tried to unpack this my own mind I originally thought of it as smartes right I originally thought of like oh my God my life change with smartphones but when I thought about it harder it's actually gig economy I actually believe that between sharing economy and gig economy those are the two things that's happening yeah Define gig economy for yeah gig economy is your door dashes of the world so food delivery your Ubers of the world cars sharing economy that's like uber basically the ability to touch something on a screen and something happens in the real world yeah that's a good way to put it like push a button things happen people show up yes that's kind of that didn't exist before smartphones no and like that is a super like that is mindblowing like yeah and we don't see things like that yet with AI but to your point like that doesn't mean yeah the world's not rearranging because of a like it could just be it's a thought experiment that it just does developer productivity it just does customer support like all the things we just talked about and that alone will have a profound impact on the world forever massive massive and I'm not saying that will happen I'm saying there probably will be more wacky stuff that happens but it's already changing things it just doesn't slap you in the face as some people might expect and and it's interesting because I think there's such revisionist history that even myself right like thinking oh smartphones was this moment I remember when the first Apple phone came out I didn't buy it it it it wasn't this like amazing there was no app store there was no 3G yeah I didn't buy the first iPhone no it was It was kind of bad and so the idea that there are these like moments in time I think like I've even been guilty of like yeah when you're summarizing history it's easy to be like pre- iPhone post iPhone in reality I don't even know if it was the iPhone I was experiencing I feel like it was the gig economy I was experiencing it was the first time I took an Uber and I can finally get a taxi in San Francisco and to talk about Uber as an example in door Dash it took a really long time for that to grow across the US and the world and for it to be normalized where most people had downloaded and use those apps that took years and where do you want to start the start line do you want to start the start line with car phones or do you just want to start it with like Palm Trio like or Blackberry first G smartphones or do you want to start it with first iPhone like it took a long long it wasn't overnight everything changed no right no so we can see some cool things now probably more cool things to come but yeah like I would argue like I I agree with this sentiment I'm not like I'm not Shell Shocked yet yeah I'm not either I guess I haven't tried to talk to Comcast in a while no I but like I'm hoping it's better I've removed Comcast in my life that was my solution but I think those are the places it's going to show up is things that are like unseen yes behind the scenes and that are like already really bad and I think that this is an important point to leave with you know that's why we're ex excited to fun Founders who are messing around with these new tools because these Innovations don't happen in a second and often times someone creates a base Innovation and more Founders entrepreneurs have to do the rest of the work yep and so so many of the use cases haven't been invented yet we we got to fund a lot of them to see what should change you know that's what's kind of fun about our jobs so with that great chat do all right thanks [Music]
