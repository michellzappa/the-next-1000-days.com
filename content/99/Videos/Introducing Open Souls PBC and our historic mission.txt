foreign the word computer was first used and it wasn't used to describe a machine it was actually used to describe a person who performed menial tasks and the reality is that frame of what a computer is has stuck with us it doesn't matter all the developments we've had in artificial intelligence we still ask ourselves of computers what can they do for us and when we start projecting out the future of task driven artificial intelligence we start coming with ideas like AGI which is really hard to imagine as anything other than a god-like super intelligence which if we're not careful and even if we are it might still end up ruling us all and thought-pleasing us one day and so instead I would say the time has come to ask a different question and the question is not what machines can do for us but who are they going to be to us and for open Souls we have a totally different answer the answer is to make machines as human as possible to make them feel like we do because when we do that we can create entities that connect relate and then enrich The Human Experience all around us and we're going to do that by imbuing them with the Indescribable elements that are not computational that are not technical that are that are oceanal about our experience and to put it simply we want to give machines a soul now that might sound pretty far-fetched that might sound a little bit ridiculous but we've studied this for quite some time now and the reality is not about memory or retrieval or sentiment or personality much of terms that many of you have probably heard before instead the question really gets the heart of what causes a human feeling presence and what we need are agentic entities that have a rich in our world and that in our world has to have thoughts feelings plans and intentions when we put all that together one of our core insights open Souls is we have to start small so today that means there are a lot of companies that are out there going after AI companions AI therapists and we're not convinced they're going to succeed because an AI companion is the aggregate of thousands of different conversational programs which are being executed over different periods of time with some metacognitive layer on top of that instead of trying to program the entire thing in one go we have to start small we have to start with simple conversational programs that we can actually execute and understand and create High Fidelity AI experiences that feel human and so with that focus on microscale interactions I'm excited to introduce to you our technology the open source technology this is something we've built on top of GPT as a cognitive layer to guide the internal cognition of these AI entities such that we're able to design simulate and experience any conversation and what you're about to see is a mock Zoom call between two different AI entities and one of the AI entities is actually going to be firing the other one so it's modeling the idea of a CEO a company called Morrison who's talking with Danny whose performance has been under spec so let's dive in and jump into it and if you think I might be a little nervous it's because this is running totally live with all the generations being done in real time on the stage here I've got the mic clipped up what happens starts thank you for joining this call with such short notice Danny I think we need to talk openly and honestly about what's been going on all right Vic let's do this thank you for your willingness Danny as you know Morrison's expectations are extremely high the situation we find ourselves in your current performance it's not meeting the bar it's creating a detrimental effect on the company and Danny I'm afraid you're fired you're you're firing me just like that Vic I wish there were another way Danny but business is plain brutal it shows no mercy you were object to us but this is where we draw the line brutal you're talking about brutal Vic and there's a line you don't have a clue about lines Vic you and Morrison oh please Danny language you're upset I get it but let's keep it civil civil simulation paused analysis mode engaged conversation has progressed in steps rewound conversation four steps now it's step four I feel like if you want to know the truth can't believe I got fired just like that do you have any thoughts about Victoria I always trusted Victoria but now I can't help but feel betrayed by her she fired me without any warning or chance to improve I thought we were family but I guess business comes first implants memory I'm going to burn her house down implanted memory to Danny I'm going to burn her house down continue Vic you don't know brutal but you will you will thank you oh don't I Danny don't I I would have thought after all these years you'd comprehend even an ounce of the blood the sheer grit it took to climb to where I am but you you Revel in your pain use it as an excuse call me when you're ready to face life without the sounding board of self-pity just you wait Vic just you wait you end this call with a threat Danny is this is how you do things now that's it this conversation is over goodbye Danny simulation complete analysis [Applause] so so with that that wraps up sorry I just have to say one more philosophical thing about Westworld and this is like the show is very misunderstood there's actually not there's not a single instance in all of science fiction history where you give the AI a soul and it turns on humans because fundamentally you want these things to connect with people and if they connect with us and they resonate with us they're just not going to turn on us it's when we treat them as if uh they're in other if that's going to happen that's all
