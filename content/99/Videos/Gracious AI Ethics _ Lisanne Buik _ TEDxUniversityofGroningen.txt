[Music] [Applause] I'm really excited for you also because you are graduating in the age of AI you have an entirely new Level Playing Field in which you can start companies with AI build AI partner with AI and shape a future in which AI is integrated into every aspect of our lives but with great power also comes great responsibility so I wanted to have a little chat with you about AI ethics before I've been in your shoes I have felt the pool of ambition too and it can be a slippery slope 13 years ago fresh out of uni I started my own tech company with the ambition to build and scale it sustainably and ethically but after four years only I found myself in a company that was mostly focused on making money pleasing our investors and getting media attention somewhere along the way I had lost sight of my ethical compass and I needed a crisis to learn what I know now that my entrepreneurial efforts are more effortless more fulfilling and more success uccessful if I operate with Grace and what that means I will share with you today and since the ethical stakes in AI are so high it is essential that we guide it with Grace my name is lisana be I today I research and materialize the future for a living and I consult companies and governments on AI ethics and for the past six years I've had an absolute obsession with artificial intelligence learning everything about it what it is what it means and how we can make sure we don't mess this up today I want to explore two key questions with you one is a positive future with AI even possible and two what can you do as the Future Leaders to guide its development and deployment with grace for the first question by of hands please show me who here wants to make a positive future with AI possible great it's almost everyone and I believe if we want to make it possible it is possible possible but not yet realized AI today faces ethical challenges like data bias privacy concerns and the centralization of power in the hands of only a few AI companies these ethical challenges have long-term consequences but these are quite abstract for us to grasp so what I did I created two opposing futures for you that live on on a spectrum of future possibilities on the one hand we have the amorph theine and on the other the IM morphos the amorphic is a gracious era in which AI will be aligned to Nature's principles and will prioritize resilience vitality and well-being of the entire ecosystem artificial intelligence in that world could just as much be called natural intelligence because it closely resembles it imagine a coral reef AI that analyze and analyzes and helps us restore coral reefs as a vital organ of the ocean and a home for countless species that's an Amorphis type of AI on the other hand we have the imorph which is a purely technological era stemming from a worldview that exponential growth and super intelligence is the most important in that worldview humans would see themselves as separate from and Superior to Nature imagine uploading your mind into the cloud and traveling to space as a Quantum software program that is an imorph isine dream or another one is neuralink by comp accompanied by Elon Musk a brain implant that gives you superum intelligence well when I was your age I wanted to be the smartest person in the room and these things may have sounded super in interesting and they still do of course but today i' rather be wise than smart we have to understand that these AIS in an IM morphos worldview don't really understand the complexities of what it means to be human they may understand rational intelligence but emotional spiritual social bodily and natural intelligence they undervalue it so that is why I feel so passionate about inspiring people like you to develop and deploy AI that is a gracious partner to humanity and to Nature the choice is really ours to make what future do you want do you prioritize super intelligence and control or do you prioritize a future of collective thriving and if that is a future of collective thriving that's really great news because it's really people like you who can make the most significant contribution because you you will be impacted most in your careers you will serve this immense wave of innovation with AI in the coming years and you are hopefully idealistic enough to even care now it remains how do we make this happen for that I made a very simple algorithm for you g r a c if you remember anything from my talk let it be these five key principles G stands for goal function the goals and values we program into AI today we find ourselves not in a crisis of solutions we have many we we find ourselves in a crisis of values because we have lost a little bit of touch with what's truly important in life in the internet boom that looked like some of the brightest people on this planet being employed to optimize advertising traffic in the AI age this impact could be exponentially higher and it could look like some of the brightest people in this room partnering with some of the most advanced algorithms to make the rest of us buy clothes we we don't need and that we probably throw away next year again is that the future we want what if we could tweak the goal function of the algorithm so that it would recommend us sustainable materials or regenerative materials and I did a little exercise in the extreme of that maybe we could even help to use AI to help us print materials that simply regenerate and we can dispose into Earth after wearing them like these Underpants made from myelo ask yourself what is truly important to you what gives your life meaning and then let's program these things into AI not the other ones our sense for resonance teaching AI that we are nature who in this room feels connected to Nature it's not everyone and that's not strange because in the west we've grown disconnected from nature we have been told that we are separate from nature but we have to REM remember that if a AI believes that we are separate from nature it will not care for nature and we um yeah we can never have a flourishing future with AI so we have to move from a perception of I think therefore I am which is popularized by deskart and Plato to a more resonant and sensible I feel therefore I am let's make this more concrete with an example from my work with the Dutch government so as you may know the dutchies have been very sophisticated at controlling water and rivers by building the D dkes and famous Delta works but this strategy with rising sea levels is probably not enough and it might not be sufficient an imorph theine dreamer would say well I'm going to employ AI to build even stronger dams and even higher dkes but an Amorphis in worldview would say w can we use sensors to analyze Coastal ecosystems in their complete complexity that we humans would not be able to understand and build natural defenses or enhance them like sand dunes or celp forests I imagined what an El Farmer in the amorph theine would look like she would use sensors to analyze co uh ocean tides and currents and really create optimal conditions for growing her crops she also would use 3D printing and AI to print garments like these garments you see in this in this video or create products like packaging for her crops my point is in anything you do remember there's a wealth of original and unbiased data waiting to be unlocked in a natural world and only if we teach AI to be resonant to Nature and truly train our own muscle to feel connected to our true nature and to Nature we can create that flourishing future with AI asence for for agency a model for alignment of artificial intelligence what what do I mean with agency agency is our capacity to make our own decisions and to act on our own behalf we all know that companies use our data in ways beyond our knowing making us buy these things that we don't need but we have to remember the long-term consequences of that in the case of AI you see age uh AI is just a little child it may may be intelligent but it's not yet wise wisdom is achieved through live experience for interacting with the world and with others and if we teach AI now that it's okay to manipulate how can we expect it to turn out as a wise adult so in any business Endeavor we do let's make data Integrity our priority and this could look like if you have a company that you give your customers decision making power over uh their data make them own their data and let you use it if we act as authentic agents and respect the agency of others we can guide ai's character in the right direction C stands for collaboration thinking win-win Nature has thrived for Millennia on collaboration Every Creature plays a vital role in the web of life we humans can rejoin that dance of collaboration and co-create with nature solutions to our environmental challenges imagine that we can decide for animal language with AI like a Google Translate for nature maybe we could understand and feel what will song really is and study their migration patterns and protect the areas they swim through through that are vulnerable to over fishing by making sure that we have healthy and happy will populations they can inter do their job they can protect our food security by maintaining healthy o ocean ecosystems and the food chain of which they are a part it doesn't stop with that we also have to you know step out of our silos that we've been in scientists should work with policy makers artists people in business and local communities indigenous communities to co-create Solutions with AI that are a win-win for all e is for embodiment teaching AI bodily and emotional intelligence we hopes that within some years we're not glue to our screen screens anymore 8 hours a day yeah that's also almost everyone and me too but the good news is in the age of AI we will finally be able to use this wisdom of this body and see it represented AI can be operated through more intuitive interfaces like spatial Computing and voice commanding imagine having your personal well-being coach in your ear helping you understand more of what these subtle cues are that your body gives you these emotions these pains that your body sends you every second of every day I imagined this microbiome AI it would measure and analyze your microbiome gives you personalized nutrition plans and informs you and educates you about God help empowered with this microbiome AI you can make better informed decisions about what and what not to eat you can also work again with 3D printing and AI to print garments infused with probiotics that that help you nourish your microbiome whilst you're wearing them for you this final principle is really my invitation to you to upgrade your bodily and emotional intelligence in the age of AI because that's what makes us human that's what set us apart from the machine and those are an integral part of our ethical compass and how we can navigate so I've just given you my algorithm for guiding AI with Grace with this gracious AI applications like Universal Healthcare Universal education and the Regeneration of our planet are no longer utopian dreams but achievable goals these possibilities make me come alive and be very very hopeful about the future and beyond that they make me want to contribute in the best way I can and I hope they do the same for you by guiding AI with Grace you can unlock Future possibilities Beyond Your Wildest imagination good luck and be gracious out there [Applause] [Music]
