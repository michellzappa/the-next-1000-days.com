hey everyone I have some pretty crazy news to share with you today YC is doing the first ever fall batch applications are due August 27th and we fund you for $500,000 all you have to do is apply on ycombinator comom slapp now let's get on with the episode Nidia became the most valuable company in the world who would have thought there's been a lot of concerns with the different articles online as are saying is AI is overinvestment [Music] hey everyone welcome back to another episode of the Lite cone I'm Gary this is Jared Harge and Diana and collectively we have funded companies worth hundreds of billions of dollars but when they were just you know one or two people sometimes just an idea one of the things that we're doing a lot of these days is funding AI companies these are some of the things that people are saying about AI now that it's a hype cycle that nobody's ever going to make money out of this can you look at how much money is being put into Nvidia into Data Centers there's just no way numerically that this whole Space could possibly make money this is do all over again this is the Crypt boom and bust all over again you know Doom and Gloom deceleration is type stuff one of the memes that comes to mind for me when I think about Market hysteria is this hilarious cartoon it's uh pretty famous I've got a stock here that could really Excel sell Excel sell sell sell sell and then the next frame is this is madness I can't take it anymore goodbye goodbye bye bye bye it's just like the sort of Madness that overtakes the market we're also really familiar with the Gartner hype cycle or we have our own version of it which is sort of the life cycle of a YC startup which is sort of the Wiggles of false hope and then like long trough of sorrow and then you know finally actually getting to the promised land where are we right now you know a lot of people uh who we saw who were just starting out in their careers asked us at startup school just a few Just A Week Ago should I actually even be working on AI right now which is like the craziest question from what I can tell where's that fear coming from from all the found Founders that are looking for an idea they're like looking at this is this real or is this a hype when you're early in your career you actually you know have maybe read about uh the hype Cycles in the past the the $200,000 parties every Friday or Saturday nights just like free flowing booze and just crazy bakanal in San Francisco in 1999 1998 like you read about it and you hear oh like all of those companies died and you sort of worry is that you know where we're at now yeah I'd say it's been kind of a surprising experience for me because where we live in Silicon Valley with like our set of like friends and peers who we hang out with like people are basically just talking about AI like all the time and there's a strong consensus that like this is an incredible moment in history but when we all went to Cambridge a few months ago and met with college students um for startup School East not that many of them were working on AI very few of them were actually thinking about AI they were just like going about doing the same like regular old startups that we've seen college students start for like 20 years and I was surprised at how big a disconnect there was between those two worlds the thing that's unusual to me or novel about this current hype cycle is that I feel like startup World always goes through periods of like ideas are hot and you feel like everyone's like like it's this sort of that Meme you just talked about it's like people start getting into a particular genre of idea and then suddenly everyone's working on like uber for x or their social Mobile Local app this time around though that's both happening for AI and startup world but then if you look at like public stock market it's all like AI is having a huge impact there as well like the stock market is up this year but all the gains are coming from like the big tech companies The Magnificent Seven yeah magn 7 it's never been this concentrated in history I believe and if you think of what's driving all of the gains in like the magn and seven big tech companies it's essentially all like AI hype so I think like like I've never seen like the those two things being in sync to this degree before where like the startup stuff and the YC batches are increasingly become like trending towards 100% AI at this point and then the public market returns are essentially 100% like AI driven as well which is why I think this has captured like everyone's sort of imagination but there's also just fear that it's unsustainable and everything's going to pop and crash at some point well is it is it going to pop and crash at some point there's been a lot of concerns with the different articles online that are saying is AI is overinvestment on AI chips I mean Nvidia became the most valuable company in the world who would have thought right and then that's the like the bottom layer of the infrastructure and then a lot of folks are wondering okay you invested in all this infrastructure then something needs to happen to pay dividends for it right sort of like in the early days the analogies with railroads so you lay down the roads are there trains going to come and I mean one very extreme version of whiplash that I feel like uh is just racking all of us right now is sort of remember about maybe a year ago uh when it seemed like there were just a few Foundation models uh that were going to run away with it and there was the threat of becoming not just AGI but as artificial super intelligence you there's sort of this idea that oh no like what if there is no opportunity at all left for literally anyone else it like might destroy society and then I think now with 405b out and thropic uh claw you know sort of 3.5 sonnet is really quite competitive you actually have choice and we're sort of swinging to this other moment where we're sort of wondering like well how does value acre to Foundation models versus um sort of the the hosting companies I think they're the big winner here and then we hope that actually the software companies themselves whether they're startups or incumbents are uh also just getting the benefit of these Foundation models yeah I feel like because everything is moving so fast it's it's easy to underestimate how important that point is like if we roll ourselves back to the start of 2023 a few months after chat GPT had just launched and we were starting to see the first trickles of like AI ideas in the batch the the chat gbt rapper meme was really out there right like everybody was talking about how all these startups were going to get crushed because chat gbt and open AI would just own everything fast forward a year and a half later it's like it's clearly not going to be the case there's multiple models you've now just got like the first like true Frontier open source model coming out of Facebook which we would never have predicted that's cool right who would have thought the beating and best model was going to be the open source because it was trailing uh six months to a year behind what openi was doing right I remember before this last um llama release like the four of us were just talking about it as wouldn't it just be great if just the lag between like the frontier models and open source like every time there was a new release that open source could catch up like within X months and if we could just make X smaller and smaller it would be very exciting but to be at like essentially parity I don't think any of us even saw that coming a month ago yeah we're there I mean there's that graph that the open source models were on an exponential and ostensibly the frontier models look like they're on an s-curve and what you're saying Gary about the difference in terms of what the current batch right now in summer is using for models versus let's say six months to a year ago is very different I do remember the numbers roughly in the previous batches I want to say like 90ish perent 80% of folks were using open AI models because that was the best and that's simply what was working and now uh we did a casual survey and Son it claw 3.5 there's actually quite a lot of folks using it back then it was only like one or two folks companies and now there's like a couple dozen of them using it and also Lama is like a lot more so I think we're seeing the open AI model usage uh because all of these are becoming comp of losing market share in the current batch as we speak yeah Gary I think you make a really good point about it being not clear where the value URS like even if you believe that AI is going to be massive and it's going to be like trillions of dollars of value created there's still a great deal of uncertainty over who will capture the Lion Share of that is it the GPU makers is it the hosting providers is it the model developers is it the application developers like like which pieces get commoditized and which pieces become incredibly valuable and reminds me a lot of like both web 1.0 and Web 2.0 you had the same phenomenon where there were a lot of people were very bullish about the overall space but it wasn't clear where you wanted to live in the space like even if you go back to like web 1.0 there is a massive hype over owning the browser like for a long time it was believed that like the way to like become super rich in the internet was to like own the internet browser because that was the gateway to the internet right and like Netscape was valued at like it was like uh you know I don't know billions of dollars at the time turns out that wasn't the place to play but that wasn't obvious for years I think the time is an important part because if you think of um again in our own world and our careers the some of the biggest companies YC's funded would be door Dash and instacart being two examples um which were really driven by us all having smartphon and being wanting to do things on our phone Uber obviously like another huge company um but those were all released or at least like the first versions of those came out like almost I think around four years post the iPhone like coming out like these things take a while before you really know which ideas are going to take off and where all the value is going to go I I think uh one really important fact is that there are all of these other parts of the value chain obviously there's the foundation model there's the hosting provider there's a chipmaker and then way over here are the startups we're funding which is the application layer and the the important thing to note is that you do not need a $100 million to start an application layer company you just need you and sometimes just you usually a co-founder and then if both of you know how to code you can literally take sort of these hyper powerful things that are now basically off the shelf and then go into some other market and you can create a product solve a real problem literally get money from people who are willing to pay you forever if you can actually solve their problems using the technology at hand and you can do it all from the desk that or you know literally the computer that you're looking at this video from like you don't need any permission other than literally a working internet connection and the laptop you have which is exactly the story of instagam card and door Dash right those are application layer companies enabled by like the mobile phone technology ship but they didn't need to like make their own phones it was just exactly what you said Gary yeah and every other part of it it's like yeah maybe you do need you know 50 hundred million dollar to get your foundation model company off the ground maybe you do need that much for Fabs or hosting or all these other things but even then like I guess that's not entirely true like it's just that much harder I think also so if we go back to this like are we in an AI hype cycle question and try and like if we Define it more precisely no one's saying that AI has literally zero value like it's pretty clear that it does I think usually when people talk about hype Cycles what they what they're reacting to is they're seeing the price of things go up very very quickly like whether that's like public market stocks like Nvidia like you mentioned or even in startup world where you see like you know companies get to a billion dollar valuation within like 6 to 12 months of starting um which has happened with some of these uh very famous AI researcher teams that used to work at Deep mind let's say or at open AI they leave and start and without product Market fit six months later they have this giant valuation I don't know right it kind of reminds me of um Professor coins back in the crypto boom like if you had distributed systems experience and you know you could just walk into even like the first person you meet who is a crypto and you would walk out with you know a billion to 5 billion dollar market value like just without having even a line of code even like a white paper like nothing crypto is the perfect example right like that that was the last time it hasn't even been that long ago it's been two years the last time it felt like there was a hype cycle it specifically defined as hey it seems to us like the value of these companies is increasing at like an unsustainably Fast Pace that was all these crypto companies that were like doing their token launches and just just raising Equity rounds and seeing valuations like double and triple every 3 to 6 months so I think there's definitely some scar issue from that on the flip side that is also just the startup world like I mean there have always been startups that at every phase feel like they're overhyped and the valuation is too large and they'll never grow into it but like I remember people saying that about stripe when it first launched because stripe had raised this big round from sequia valued at like $100 million and I don't think they'd even publicly launched yet it was all belief in the founders and the idea and the market and so that is partly just the business is investors invest like hoping to make money and the way they make money is that whatever price they pay today is like there's profit to be made by how much the company's going to grow in the future but there's a big difference that is maybe a bit nuanced between how to Value technology company versus things that are more like asset speculative right because in the crypto world there's a lot of that so maybe we can speak to that versus true technology I wouldn't say that it's purely speculation though like I would say that uh when you have investors with billions of dollars to deploy you have a hammer and all you see are nails and what you're trying to do is uh put as much money as possible behind uh people and teams that seem like shelling points for other intelligent people so that's probably what happened with stripe You could argue that it is actually somewhat rational maybe not to like the you know billion Doll Market values that people got but it is somewhat rational that if you are a professor in distributed systems with a certain Network the other people you need to actually create uh you know a working cryptocurrency that people trust and build apps on that's actually the set of people who could do it and then the money closes the door behind you and I would argue that like that's some of the reason why you have things like cognition labs and Devon you have uh you know things like Harvey that is the market trying to figure out where is the talent shelling point for really smart people and like if we all sort of go all in it actually you know sort of buffers that company from uh frankly competition like and you you know it's sort of like the classic Peter teal uh you know sort of speech about competition is for losers I think it's literally on this y combinator Channel actually and so it's not totally irrational but it is uh worth lampooning at some level I think that's a fair way to look at the crypto stuff inantly I think during that period you could divide it out into the asset speculation which was essentially people who had really focused on launching these tokens very very quickly and trying to get the price of tokens up but there were also legitimately credent like very intense technical teams that were trying to work on building new protocols and trying to take like existing services and bu decentralized versions of them and I think the investor mindset was kind of what you're saying it's like hey actually like we shouldn't bet against smart technical people trying to work on really hard technical problems and there were lots of those within crypto and so let's invest ahead of product Market fit because yeah like these people will attract the next like smart people and if there's something here these are the people that will figure it out so I I think I think it's scrypto analogy is really good because when Diane and I spoke with a lot of the best students at at Harvard and MIT one of the consistent things that we heard from them was that a lot of them felt burned by the crypto hype cycle either personally or or or or they had friends like they were they were old enough to to to to have been around for the 2020 21 2022 like crypto hype cycle and a lot of them were now a bit skeptical of AI and like whatever the like new hotness thing is as a result and so like you two were the the founding investors of coinbase and some of the most successful crypto investors in the world what how would you compare what happened with crypto in 2021 with what's happening with AI now how is it similar how is it different coinbase I think was remarkable in that it was not um actively a cryptocurrency per se it was the enabling technology that you would need uh in order for it to actually happen and they're still on that journey I would argue I mean Brian Armstrong and earnings you just this week started talking about you know we are actually working with or talking to every financial institution in the world to incorporate blockchain technology into like the actual Norms of finance and I think that that was always sort of the promise that I was excited about when I met Brian uh first when he was uh you know an anti-f fraud engineer coming out of uh Airbnb actually yeah like coinbase was essentially a Marketplace and I think it just it didn't look too different to any other startup where it was like oh hey there's this thing that people want to buy and sell to each other there's no great Marketplace for doing that so why don't we just build like a trusted Marketplace and it was Fringe and Niche it was I don't think people at the moment thought it was going to go the way it did that was it the unknown with coinbase was how big is the market but it very clearly had product Market fit with the people that cared about it early on like there were absolutely people who wanted to buy and sell Bitcoin that needed a better way to do it so there was never any doubt that coin B had utility in the sense of hey there's this group of people that want to do something that coinbase is making easier for them to do I think what feels different about AI Now versus crypto is just that like sniff test of when you look at the products a lot of the web 3 stuff in particular for most people just never really passed the sniff test of like I don't get why I would use this but when you look at like AI products it's very very clear that being able to like summarize a 50 page PDF market analysis report and actually pluck out like the three key points is clearly like utility that someone will pay for I mean there's a company in my current POD at YC right now and they can do accounts receivable like they took a 12 person team and it turned into one person working on accounts receivable and 11 other people could work on all the other things in finance and that's like about as tangible as you can get like literally you're taking something that it's like not better than literally being a human passing butter and we're replacing them with butter passing robots and there's actually you know it's kind of it's It's a Rick and Morty joke but on the other hand it's kind of serious actually like how much better is the world that software is doing that thing that you know actually is not the most awesome thing that a human could be doing which is like reconciling like an email and a you know Bank record to what needed to be paid like that's not invigorating like work that you know turns on your creativity right it's something that is sometimes maybe torture for people you know and we can give people other things that they can do and it's it's that's the kind of thing that we get to see right now we're literally seeing it right like you danana looked up some numbers here I mean the cool stat is uh we did mentioned this in a previous episode on uh batch by the Numbers the total revenue that if we aggregate all the revenue that companies come in when they apply to YC it was 6 million by the end of the batch about 3 four months later if we add up all the revenue that they grew into it was 20 million which is like huge over just three four months and it succeeds exceeds a lot of the advice that we give that's still ambitious like try to grow your company 20% month over month that's still like an exponential growth and if you use that Benchmark 20% month over month from six to from 6 million over 3 4 months is only about like 12 million so like 20 million we're seeing real Revenue that's actually getting acur and when companies land on a good idea that value that you're talking about Gary their customers recognize it I mean customers are Discerning they're paying for it and there is that kind of value aspect of it yeah and then I think the trickiest thing is it can't just be the you know the first renewal or the second renewal like you actually have to survive all the renewals like the only way there's Enterprise Value in a company is Believe It or Not discounted cash flows from the future so that means retention has to be like every customer you get you better have that customer forever and that's the only way you can build a business of any value and that also seems to get to the heart of this um are we in a hype cycle argument or not because I feel like at YC all of us are on the ground floor seeing examples of companies that are ramping up to like a million dollars of AR faster than we're used to seeing with companies during a batch and even in like the 6 to 12 months post the batch that Revenue ramp is impressive gustaf's being talking about Leia who just closed like their series a from Benchmark um doing like legal AI to automate legal work there's a company that I worked with a year ago that is probably going to end at 10 Millions by the end of this year this is just 12 months later after they landed on the idea man 10x after that you could IPO and I think this is so different to like Jared and I when we moved to San Francisco in like 2007 right cuz there were the thing that everyone was chasing you had this with posterous too like the thing everyone was chasing was like um page views yeah page views and then like active users and um just I know registered accounts whatever it was but vanity metrics is what you're saying like things that make you feel good but well I want to I want to jump into a point that Harge made earlier which is like if you define a hype cycle as a situation in which a lot of assets are overvalued that might be the case right now like Nvidia is the most valuable company in the world right now I don't know if it should be like maybe Nvidia is overvalued and like tpus are going to start working and like you know like all all all all those things could change there's a bunch of startups that rais a billion dollar Plus valuations in hindsight th like some of those deals will probably look really silly the good news for our business is we don't care like you know if we were Public Market investors you'd be very worried about you know whether Nvidia was overvalued or not but given like where we play it literally doesn't matter yeah I mean I would argue for Founders yeah it's actually good and even if some things are overvalued yeah like I mean it's actually sort of free money for the whole ecosystem like Nvidia being overvalued equals if they needed to raise money they could raise it very cheaply it's more Capital that allows them to drive the future sort of much faster and then everyone in the rest of the ecosystem basically benefits from that and this is where there is like huge difference between where we and the founders are and like Public Market companies are like public market companies have to deliver quarter after quarter like if they miss an earnings report the stock tanks employees start getting itchy it's a massive distraction but when like you know as YC we're investing in people when they're just ideas like we don't expect the things we don't expect to know if something's working or not for like 10 plus years right which is the same for the founders and viewed on like a 10-year Horizon doesn't really matter if things are overvalued today you just care about directionally is this going to be worth more in 10 years than it is today well I think the businesses are actually quite a bit more healthy or can be not not always like you know I think maybe that's one of the more uh dangerous things about uh whether it was Professor coins that raised hundreds of millions of dollars and like never launched or you know frankly some of the AI Darlings today that might have already been blessed by the you know world's biggest VC funds but they're looking at a balance sheet that has $100 million or $200 million or $500 million and uh absolutely zero Revenue like how do you actually you it's sort of like looking straight up at Mount Everest and saying like how am I going to actually climb this and it's a weird contrast to a bunch of the YC companies that we see where you know yeah they might have only raised a million to2 million do out of demo day but they're starting to hit their Milestones of5 or10 million and that actually because they were profitable from day one or relatively quickly the bank account has only gone up for them and they look down and say well I raised the seed round I don't have any board uh you know I don't have to sell any more of my company so why don't I just build the company the way I want and you know I think maybe 10 years ago there were not that many examples of it in the YC world you know there was sort of Weebly that only raised a seed round and then sold for uh you know a massive sum to square later uh and they could do it because they were profitable in our era of social software even today is zapier is probably one of the most dominant pure software companies that only Ever Raised a seed round and you know they're driving hundreds of millions of dollars in Revenue it's uh sort of like this insane moment for them and they're making a huge betat on AI yeah and so it's such an interesting moment like do you really need the mega round in fact the mega round might be like such a giant load Stone around your neck you'll never actually overcome that and the fascinating thing is with these companies that we kind of mentioned they are hitting profitability or break even and they don't need to raise and they have this this Revenue that is coming in and growing exponentially and they don't have to so perhaps you don't hear as much about them because they don't go public and try to do the mega rounds because they're really playing the long game and if I think about the categories of things that we're starting to see now that we have a bit more data I think in every single area for AR for for AI we are seeing early signs that things are working even for some things that people think are overhyped like uh think of a generative AI to generate images I think it's hard to imagine oh is this just for toy or just for art or just for fun but there's a company uh photo room that actually is making real Revenue um and I think they recently announced they're valued at half a billion dollars and they're generating images for e-commerce so when you go in a vertical specific like them they figure out something and they got generative AI to be very profitable because it's very hard for Brands to take pictures of images of products and product placement and all that is very hard and they've done it very cheaply you don't need a team of uh photographers right or editors that's like one example I can think of the other category uh we talked a lot about this as well is uh kind of this uh AI agent workflow right where you're replacing a team of Ops you mentioned y like green light green light's a great example um permit flow is another company that's doing essentially an AI agent that uses AI to just fill out construction permit flows and again if we if we're trying to put like the devil's advoca argue the other side about these things it would be I think there's two attacks you make one you say oh these things are like automating but they haven't fully got the human out of the loop yet and so like you know to unlock these valuations and to be worth this much amount of money they really have to get humans out of the loop um and the second would be that just Enterprises are never going to trust these things and so you're not going to sign up like six figure or million dollar contracts with big 14500 companies relying entirely on AI Oh I thought the second one they were going to say har is that like they're going to be commoditized so they're just like gbt rappers and like all the all the real value is going to queue to the foundation models and there's going to be like 100 permit flows and so how will they capture any of the actual value on that one though I just feel I feel like that that indeed was the big criticism that was the main attack like a year ago and I I maybe I'm just this is based because I so strongly believe it's just been debunked at this point but just everything we talked about like multiple models open source like being permit flow being the winner in your space is as far as I can tell all about figuring out how to sell getting the details of the UI correct like owning like all of the little details to get the product perfect I agree with you har I was just yeah that's fair I was making other people's argument yeah it seems if anything that the opposite is likely to be true that the Valu is going to Inuit to the permit flows this even like even to the it's not just a rapper even at the technical layer I know they do a lot of work to really fine-tuning to a domain is specific there's a lot of power to private data in these spaces with permits with banking data that cannot be done and replicated and there's actually a lot of finesse there that they actually is not just a rapper there's like a lot of really thought out work that is a great point I mean there's a Mark Zuckerberg quote I think he made he he said this maybe a week or two ago about how even if all the model development progress froze today there would still be five years worth of innovation to go on just like the application Level um or the application layer of building Point Solutions on top of the models and even uh on the side of a copilot right even with a GitHub copilot the most famous example is apparently the fastest growing product for github's Revenue it accounted for apparently 40% of the growth recently and it's been rumored reported that they're making in the hundreds of millions of Revenue that's still to be verified but around that much which is significant over just when was it released a couple years ago right another anecdote I could throw out on the point of this needs to get humans completely out of the loop to really be as valuable as everyone says it is anecdotally what I've heard from some startups is uh they're building it into the workflow so that the AI like does the work but then you can sort of spot have a UI to spot check or just like have a human do the review process but increasingly like the customers are not even using the feature anymore they're just like I heard that too I heard that too and I have this other company that's basically replacing a lot of the call centers and they are processing hundreds of thousands of calls and same thing they're like all these bpos offshore call centers in the Philippines or Mexico they fired that whole Center and and this big enterpris is using this startup for like 20 times 100 times cheaper and faster and same thing and to your point like even if it's not perfect right now and there is not like another 10x Frontier Model coming out anytime soon all of the work like the fine-tuning Gathering the dayl like the private data repos like it's very plausible that alone will just squeeze out and get to like the right level of quality where big Enterprises will just start like spending millions and tens of millions of dollars on all of these Solutions that's actually the fourth category that I think is also working out while yes there's a lot of tooling right now to build LM to do evaluations fine-tuning etc etc there are a couple of our company a number of them that actually are having success with doing fine-tuning specifically this tooling for Enterprises that are working with their private data if you want to skip the specific application even the tooling is valuable I also think there's just like a lot more places to apply LMS to that people haven't even thought of like Diane and I have a company in our group that just two weeks ago went to this conference of like a particular industry conference and they had this like Eureka moment where they realized that there's an entire industry that is a perfect application for llms that literally nobody who's a technologist even knows about or knows exists and so like there's no one who's even trying and they're just like you know like off off to the races with this like billion dollar opportunity in an obscure corner of the world that's a perfect fit for this technology so as as you're saying Harge I think there's like years worth of just unlocking of the current technology I think G you had a very good framework to kind of think about this in terms of that war and Buffet popularity and we machine you kind of tell us about that yeah I I think ultimately that's what's playing out here I mean it's played out in uh every hype cycle boom bus cycle in not just technology but sort of in the world there's sort of uh this Mania that begins like the world is going to change uh and then it's so hard to actually understand what's going on that um a lot of it is in sort of hearsay or in the media and this is what x says like you know on product hunt there's this like there's sort of a fog of War around what's going on and then that what that results in is a popularity contest it's basically a in the short term all businesses are sort of voting subject to the voting machine right like it's not what is actually happening yet like it's happening so quickly that uh humans are sens making machines and it takes time for us to make sense and so in the short term we are tricked by very fast talking husters we are tricked by uh fancy credentials or you know I worked at such and such company there's sort of the clinkle of the world like the fast talking Stamford Dropout that like scams very smart investors out of millions of dollars right like you get a lot of that and that's just like the vagaries and The Madness of the voting machine right like it's not like people are trying to put money into things that are scams it's more that um just by purely social effects we cannot make you sense of the world fast enough and you know basically the mob gets it wrong and then on the flip side like in the long run though like ultimately the value of every company is uh discounted cash clows from the future you know you need your customers to actually have a problem be solved people pay them and then uh you know your customers stick with you forever that's why when you look at a Google or a meta or you know any of the Magnificent 7 those companies are the most valuable companies in the world because people feel that there you know those companies May well make money forever right and there's safety in that that's sort of like what people you know believe now and then the public markets ultimately are sort of uh you know they themselves are both totally crazy voting machines as well but they eventually resemble weighing machines like ultimately you actually have to make money ultimately you actually have to have customers and at that
