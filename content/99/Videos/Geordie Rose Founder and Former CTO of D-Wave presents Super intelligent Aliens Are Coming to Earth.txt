so we had a I'm going to talk about aliens uh but before I do that we had a little bit of interesting news today um that's Kindred relevant and I wanted to share it with you because I'm pretty proud of it um so we um Kindred was named to a list of the mit's uh smartest 50 companies and this is a very prestigious list it's very hard to make it but the thing that was distressing about it is that they have this map that they show of where all these companies are from and there wasn't a single company on the list that was from Canada not a single one which was a little surprising of course because we're from Vancouver but they they thought that we were from San Francisco because we have an office there but we're not we're from here uh three years ago the previous company that I founded d-wave also made the list and it was also the only company from Canada that was on the list at that time so um there I've been trying to build the Tech Community in Vancouver for 25 years and I find it super depressing that it seems to be so hard to generate world-changing zero to one companies around here you know I think that I'm gonna I'm gonna just pitch this idea some of you may have seen me talk about this before but we have this problem here that we don't think big enough we've got all the ingredients to create this massive massive thing in Vancouver and the spark is not being lit so I implore you if you're entrepreneurs people are thinking about what you want to do think bigger because we don't think big enough around here okay so my previous company was d-wave I'll just uh show you a couple things we built what are still the world's only quantum computers that you can buy and the company d-wave has been doing this thanks I didn't really have much to do with it but you know because so this is one of them um this is one of the processors and uh a lot of interesting things happened to me over the years there I got sent pajamas a whole bunch of stuff you know there's lots of interesting things that happen when you build something like quantum computer but just as an aside because I thought it was funny one of the interesting things that's happened from the d-wave story is there's this gigantic uh conspiracy that's Arisen on the internet that goes like this so d-wave builds quantum computers the way that they work if you know this how this works is one of the interpretations is that you tap into these parallel universes and they do computations sounds really weird but uh what what what's happened is this idea is being hijacked to describe something called the Mandela effect which is this thing where um the past changes so think about something you know to be true from the past and then imagine you went out on the internet and you can't find it at all it's not there it doesn't match with your experience so these people think that Dua is responsible and certain and of course the quantum key to the abyss factors into it somehow I'm not exactly sure how Okay so that that's just d-wave uh I did that for about 15 years it was a lot of fun a big science project that we turned into a commercial entity uh that was a warm-up for Kindred so Kindred is much much more ambitious than d-wave and what Kindred is trying to do is build real AI so what you've heard about AI is not what we mean by AI what we mean by AI is a software system that can do literally anything that a human can do literally anything and obviously computers are better at things than people in lots of different ways so now imagine not only can they do everything that a human can do but they can do everything that the best human at any task could do better than them so imagine there was the mental Olympics of the 100 meter dash and Usain Bolt is the fastest person I'll imagine that's some kind of a mental thing like writing a novel or writing whatever imagine now that the thing is so much faster than Usain Bolt like for example it's a spaceship yeah it's it's still doing the same thing but it's doing it so much better because we're limited because we're people so um what Kindred is trying to do is solve this problem how do you build machines that are better than people at everything now there's a mental block that we have here when we think about this because when you think about that one of your questions might be for example what are the applications of this so imagine this imagine for ten dollars let's say I could build a a machine like a little robot that had fingers and eyes and all that and it could do your job better than you no matter what it is and I could sell that to your employer for say fifteen dollars and make a profit instead of having to pay you a hundred thousand dollars a year now imagine that was true for every single job so that's what we're talking about here is a complete and utter transformative change that of the likes of which has never been seen before in the history of humanity making the Industrial Revolution look like a little tiny blip on the path that humans have taken from when we emerge from the Ooze a few billion years ago we are right on the verge of that transition now so uh this guy Rich Sutton is one of the most famous people in the academic world of AI and like many when asked when will this happen he says things like this 25 chance within 13 years of this thing that I'm talking about you know when you think about what is on the what you read on the news you know CNN BuzzFeed whatever they're all kind of the same nowadays think about how unimportant that thing is that you're reading if this is true yeah so what does this have to do with aliens so uh Sam Harris who I quite admire is very interesting guy um was reciting this Parable at a TED Talk that he was giving and it goes something like this so I'm uh say I'm the president of the United States so I received this message from the heavens so my microwave dish my seti dish finally captures something and what it says is in 50 years or 13 years we're coming to your planet you got to be ready now just imagine what would happen if it if that happened a super intelligent alien race beamed down a message to all of us earthlings saying we're coming July 13 2030 and boy you better be ready because the mothership is landing right on the front lawn of the White House or wherever you wanted to land on that day the amount of resources that would be marshalled to try to figure out what to do would it would Encompass the whole world AI is just like that so when this thing that I'm talking about happens it's going to be exactly the thing that you're thinking about about those super intelligent AIS so the one thing I can tell you is they're not going to be like us so alien means you know different these things that we're building are not going to be people they might be really smart they might be really good at all sorts of different things but they're not going to be like us they're going to be aliens and they're gonna be I'm sorry to say way smarter than every single person in this room in ways that we can't even comprehend so this of course triggers a lot of alarm one of the guys who talks about this is Elon who says things like this like when you do this beware because you think just like the guy in the story is that when you do this you're going to put that that that little guy in a pentagram and you're going to have your holy water out and you're going to wave it at the thing and by God it's going to do exactly what you say and not one thing more but it never works out that way so uh this isn't this is an attitude that some are having this emerging alarmism about the way this is going to go but this these words demons doesn't capture the essence of what's Happening Here uh I don't know if any of you are uh turn of the century weird fiction fans but there's this guy named H.P Lovecraft who's a very famous American weird fiction author and he exposed a a view which is called cosmicism and the essence of cosmicism is Cosmic indifference so he what he was saying is basically yes there are these massively intelligent entities out there but they're not good they're not evil they just don't give a about you even in the slightest the same way that you don't care about an ant is the same way they're not going to care about you and these things that were summoning into the world now are not demons they're not evil but they're more like the lovecraftian great old ones there are entities that are not necessarily going to be aligned with what we want so this transition is really really massively important for our entire species to navigate and going back to that thing that Sam Harris was saying nobody is paying attention this thing is happening in the background while people bicker about politics and what what's going to be in the health care plan in the U.S and Underneath It All is this Rising tsunami that if we're not careful is going to wipe us all out so um on that uh pleasant note uh we're hiring people to try to make something like this happen uh and uh of course you know this is a very uh difficult project of course and I'm I'm kind of a little bit tongue-in-cheek about all this like you know uh how how bad things are because uh it's not really like that you know there's technology is a double-edged sword even something like this uh it's agnostic it depends who wields it if you want to have a say in how all this goes down you can't sit on the sidelines and one of the ways that you can get involved and really change the world like you know a lot of people say hey join the Marines you'll change the world or whatever this is this thing this opportunity that I'm talking about here in Vancouver is an opportunity for you to literally change the world because the code that you write may be running in the brains of these things in 10 years so this is a this is a huge opportunity I I I'm going to ask that anybody here who is a software engineer who's really good uh to talk to any one of these three folks who are sat at the back there who are uh Suzanne founded Kindred um and Olivia and Paula are some of our key folks in Vancouver or talk to me and um uh we'll have a conversation by the way I love Joseph's talk it's true startup life can be very very difficult and uh you will fail many many many times before you succeed uh just as a matter of course thanks [Applause] thank you Jordy first question over here uh Jody my name is norin and I do really want to talk to you after this so you know you were talking about summoning the demon by Elon Musk right um and there are a lot of other Pioneers in this industry such as uh Andrew NJ who's a former Chief Shanti sabado when he was asked the same question about summoning the demon he said that his analogy was um it's more like thinking about all published in Mars you know it was completely opposite but when there are two Pioneers in this industry who have different sets of opinions how do you think that it's summoning a demon rather than the other way around well uh obviously people are going to have different opinions you have to make up your mind yourself so the uh my my com my general comment is that people always miss the future you know it's it's uh it's this old thing that people are always saying things will go faster than they do in the short term and slower in the long term that but it's kind of for me it's an obvious thing I mean this isn't about uh the only question is how long it will take uh if you again I encourage you to watch that Sam Harris Ted Talk if you're interested in this but the point that he makes is that as long as certain things that are probably true hold this will happen will progress continue maybe it won't maybe the Earth will get hit by a meteor and we'll all die if progress continues things that we're doing intelligence isn't magical it's not some kind of weird thing it's a it's a mechanical outcome of the way that our machines in our head work we're going to figure it out eventually and when we do we're going to make it better in all sorts of interesting ways and then you have this weird thing that happens that because the machine is now able to act in its own self-interest it can take the action to make its own thought process better we can't do that so we're stuck with what we were born with more or less we can learn things but that's not the same as getting smarter so these machines are going to be able to take control of the tools from which they are built to create better versions of themselves and that what's sometimes called an intelligence explosion is something that biological creatures can't undergo so I think it's an absolutely guaranteed outcome of progress the only question is when and I think Andrew would agree with that James hey uh great to have you out here it was a brilliant hearing you speak for the first time myself I'm sure a lot of people here would agree with me um what is your goal to stop the world from turning into that of The Terminator uh right um so I've uh you know I've so there are things about the world that I can't stand okay and I think that's probably true for everybody here you know you look at the world and there's all these things that you think why is things what are things like that so there's a couple things you can do um when you're faced with this the the one that I've I've found works for me is I'm like screw that I'm gonna do that myself right so back you know 25 years ago I was like this is why aren't there any quantum computers it's not that hard a problem and so we change the world by actually building them and in this case this is why don't we have ai it's been what 60 years since Turing I mean the the it's an absolute catastrophic failure of human resource allocation that we spend enormous amounts of money on things that are of no lasting consequence when the mechanism that generates all human flourishing is not understood it doesn't make any sense every single thing that we will ever do and ever have done comes from this property so when someday all cancer is cured when polio was cured when smallpox was cured these things all came from people's minds it's you can continue to do this stupid thing where everybody works on some particular use of the mind okay well let's go and do X let's go to Mars like Elon says that doesn't make any sense to me because every single thing that you can think of comes from the same place you got to think about what that is so if you can figure out and bottle this thing that creates flourishing that creates all of the good things that we think about you know we know about the way that we are that is the key you know do that so you know that that's kind of the way that I think about the world the world doesn't have the things it needs and it you can't just sit by and watch other people do it so uh you know the it just won't happen otherwise if I the way I think about this is if Kindred didn't exist in 20 years we're still having this conversation because the people who are trying to do AI are going to get sidetracked into making a lot of money doing all sorts of that doesn't matter so what I want to do is make sure that when we do this we're solving the real problem and we don't get sidetracked and we don't go down past it are going to make us a lot of money just because they're you know some short-term thing we do it because we understand the civilization changing importance of accomplishing this task so you know that that's that's the way I think about things things are they're not the way they should be change it yourself or also won't get changed see last question is going to go to Dave if no one raises their hand no no no no repeat questions oh okay it's going to Joseph make this good pressure's on I don't get the impression you struggle that night I think you're pretty clear in what you're set out to do it's incredible passion quick question for you so simple mind of mine I understand AI what it can do for us 10 years from now I get excited about it just share you know the applications that we can think of EQ do you ever Envision AI get in a place where we can actually have emotional intelligence or can can actually impact influence manipulate or even help on the emotional level absolutely no question by the way I really liked your talk it was really good um no I'm serious uh people don't talk about this enough you know it's always like roses and fun but entrepreneurship isn't about roses and fun it's about it's about getting your soul crushed over and over and over again and the people who succeed are the ones who keep getting up you know it's like that Rocky thing you know I'm not gonna try to do it but you know what I mean that same uh yeah so uh no my view is that if if it's a thing that you can measure it's a thing you can improve I think that being good with people so we were talking uh with some of our technical people the other day and one of them said this very funny thing I'm going to try to remember what he said he said um language is a way that we use other people as tools to achieve our goals so it's really deep right so we don't usually think about language that way but when I say something I'm trying to use you as a tool to get something I want so in this case it's we're hiring software Engineers is the main thing that I'm trying to get so I'm trying to use you as tools to satisfy this need of mine now it's it's a little bit weird to think of things that way but if you're building an AI and you go and you try to figure out what is language for language is this thing that is a way to use the people around you to get what you want which is almost it's a little sociopathic when you think of it that way but it's almost a definition of emotional intelligence is that if you are so tuned in to the responses or that the how a person will respond to the message that you provide to them not only your words but your language and how you act and what you buy and what you wear and all that that you can always predict that the outcome will be the thing that you want you're going to be very very successful and say politicians are like this you know sometimes you see people and you think these people are just like man that guy's got Charisma like I met Bill Clinton once and he was like holy I've never seen this before it's like the sparks flying off this guy what was it you know he's just got something and I think that that that's a thing that you can measure and it's a thing you can improve and I think that it's going to be a part of AI in the future not only this kind of idea of like super rational but also super good at getting what they want and that's not a bad thing right as long as what they want is something good like for example if the AI is programmed to want to make you happy say you might imagine that it will do whatever it can do to achieve that objective which might mean this sort of thing you know giving what you what you really need when you need it of what a beautifully thoughtful question to end the night uh Dave you're gonna have to bother Jordy I'm sure I'm sure it was um thank you so much uh Jordy Round of Applause [Applause]
