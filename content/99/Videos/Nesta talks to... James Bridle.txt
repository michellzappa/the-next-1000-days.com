[Music] thank you sorry about that I think I might have accidentally been muted um so welcome to our latest Nestor talks to our conversation event series for today's most exciting thinkers on the big topics related to our missions and Innovation methods my name's Laurie Smith and I lead on much of the research in the discovery Hub at Nestor the UK's Innovation Agency for social good we design test and scale solutions to society's biggest problems our three missions are to help people live healthier lives create a sustainable future where the economy works for both people and the planet and give every child a Fair start the discovery Hub is responsible for helping bring the outside into the organization by considering the consequences of external trends and emerging Technologies for nestor's work one interesting Trend that's I've been receiving um attention of late is planetary intelligence the James Bridal dives into in their book ways of being which has recently come out in paperback James the writer artist and technologist their artwork had been commissioned by Galleries and institutions and exhibited worldwide on the internet they're writing on literature culture and networks appeared in magazines and newspapers including wired the Atlantic the new Statesman the guardian and the financial times they're the author of a new Dark Age published in 2018 and ways of being which we're going to talk about which is publishing hardback in 2022 and they wrote and presented a show called new ways of seeing for BBC Radio 4 in 2019. welcome James hi there thanks very much for having me thank you very much for joining us um now before I start I want to invite our audience to join the conversation in the comments box on the right hand side of their screen to ask any questions throughout the event closed captions can be accessed via the LinkedIn live stream so let's start off so I found your book really really interesting in fact I've taken the advice from The Washington Post on the cover and actually read it twice perhaps so we can start um by asking what got you interested in the search for planetary intelligence um so I've come from sort of multiple backgrounds um my my academic background a very long time ago now was actually in artificial intelligence um in the kind of last wave of that uh getting on for 20 years ago now um so I've sort of been vaguely interested in this subject for a while while also being somewhat cynical about it and in the subsequent time my work's taking me to a few places through ART and writing mostly looking at the subject of Technology um and also mostly looking at it again with quite a sort of critical perspective so less interested in like you know the nuts and bolts of the technology though understanding them is important but really understanding their kind of social and political effects um and in the last few years you know like quite a lot of other people I imagine I've been trying to um refocus my practice like what I do what I'm interested in what I talk to people about uh around ecology and the environment as kind of clearly something quite important we should be talking about more and and which is in real need of kind of some new ideas and some new thinking um I don't know whether I can provide that but what I was really Keen to do was see how I could come to this subject and bring something from what I already knew so rather than just kind of um diving straight into ecological questions to say look I've assembled a certain body of knowledge around critical thinking around technology how might this apply in this area and one of a number of different breakthrough moments because this the way I work means these things tend to happen kind of over and over again usually quite a few times before I even notice what's happening uh the universal banging on the door but taking a while to get through um was um this kind of I really wanted to understand why people were so obsessed with artificial intelligence as something that I'd put it back for a long time and still really struggle to get that excited about maybe we'll talk a bit more about that later um but I had this sort of realization that you know there's this fascinating moment we're in where on the one hand there's all of this cultural interest in artificial intelligence um this machine intelligence whatever it is um just you know at the moment when Decades of researchers across the sciences and into kind of non-western scientific Traditions are really starting to change our idea of what intelligence is who possesses it um and the relationships we might have based on those things and I really wanted to kind of try and bring those things together and that was one of the starting points for this work really interesting I I I've noticed in that you means you're starting with a sort of theme theme of intelligence I think you sort of challenge the idea that human intelligence is unique and I've assert there are many different ways of doing intelligence examples um I mean I could pull on all kinds of things really but I mean um uh if you look back so I set out you know naively to write broadly about intelligence and to sort of talk about it a little bit and I quickly discovered that um you know it's very it's it's a very hard thing to Define and and actually when when one sets how to define it when any writer sets out to Define any theorists what you tend to end up with is these kind of grab bags of various qualities so people might talk about things like you know um complex thinking planning ahead having a sense of self tool use um like there's so many different examples of things that are considered to be these kind of markers of intelligence and then you know depending on your subject your interest you might sort of grab a few of them and put them together to to say well that that's what says what intelligence is but what's most striking is throughout this literature um you know what ultimately this comes down to is intelligence is what humans do it's always done from that perspective um and uh you know that what that's done historically is kind of radically limit our ability to acknowledge the intelligence of other beings um because they um do intelligence in all these different ways and the way I'm phrasing that is quite deliberate in that you know intelligence is not this like static fixed thing um it's changing all the time it is something that is done it's verbal as it's a verb um and so um intelligence is kind of performed in all these ways in relation to the world around us it's it's meaningless to think of like the intelligence possessed by a brain and a jar for example because they can't be anything there because there's no world to relate to and thus to kind of do intelligence with to think about and think with and as soon as you start thinking about intelligence therefore is something uh you know that that's that's about our relationship really with the world around us it stops being either singly human um or something that only happens in the head um and and really the realization I came to to writing about in this book is I the the main two terms I used to think about intelligence are Intelligence being embodied and relational uh embodiment's really key uh it's why we tend to think of intelligence as something internally human because of course we are embodied as humans and we have this body plan um I said before that um you know that this focus on human intelligence has led us to miss the intelligence of um of other beings in all kinds of ways my favorite example of that uh which illustrates the embodiment thing quite well is is Gibbons um Gibbons for a long time was subject to the kinds of uh experiments that we subject other creatures to in all kinds of ways that are supposed to like determine their intelligence in this way um according to this kind of bar that we've set that's like ours but maybe a bit lower um a classic test is like tool use right you've got an animal in a cage you put some treats outside the cage you give the animal some kind of tool like a little stick lying on the floor the animal you know uses this tool in some way to get the thing and that seemed to work for a lot of the higher primates so orangutans gorillas small children um uh and uh but also chimpanzees macaques are some monkeys as well as Apes they all seem to do this very well Gibbons for decades like refused to participate in this experiment they just didn't seem to show any interest in it at all and this doesn't make sense evolutionary because they sort of sit between us um I have problems with that evolutionary view as well but that's a slightly different issue um uh they they should have been able to do this we didn't understand why and it took decades before someone rearranged the experiment redesigned the experiment so that the the pointy the pointing sticks instead of lying flat on the floor uh were hanging from the top of the enclosure and immediately they did that the Gibbons went oh you know like this and like in that moment they became intelligent to us like they've been intelligent all along but we were suddenly capable of seeing it because we'd acknowledge that they're embodied differently um which is that gibeon's are brachiators they spend um most of their lives swinging around in the trees so they have a different body pattern they have longer fingers which make it harder to pick things up from the ground it's easier to pick things like this but also their kind of awareness is pointed upwards so they they have this intelligence they just do it differently because of their embodied nature and and from that flows this relationality this fact that um uh the the intelligence is something that emerges out of our relationships with other beings rather than just um you know being an entirely interior process and both of those then we go through as many other examples kind of point to Intelligence being something that is Universal in my understanding um but done differently and sometimes in ways that we can't even possibly comprehend by by all kinds of creatures so if intelligence this was sort of the sort of relational sort of dynamic embodied phenomena where do you set the boundaries for what intelligence is or are there any so I mean what happens is start to stop thinking about it in terms of boundaries because once again this is what we've we've always done we've wanted to draw these kind of red lines between us and other creatures and of course historically we've drawn that that between humans quite extensively as well um like the the extension of the recognition of intelligence Consciousness and much else to non-human species started a long time ago when it wasn't even extended to most humans um we've gradually expanded our recognition of the differing abilities of or members of the human species alone before we start to kind of push out further and we're still doing that process what what I think is incredibly interesting is part of this process is to stop trying to see it to see intelligence or quite a lot of other things as being like these specialized domains of difference by which we can separate things and make them different from each other but to kind of approach it essentially ecologically ecology is the um is is based on relationships right on the way in which these things connect to one another rather than the ways in which they split apart that's why ecological ways of doing science have been so revolutionary because historically most of the Western Scientific Method has been about the kind of splitting and clumping process breaking things apart cutting it up into small pieces separating them and trying to draw these like separate little diagrams of what all the little pieces do and therefore completely missing the whole Ecology of what's actually going on that's slowly being repaired and one of the ways in which we repair it is also to not treat qualities like intelligence as having like hard defined boundaries that separate things but are actually qualities that we can think about that might allow us to communicate better so my starting point well it wasn't my starting point actually at all it took me a long time to get there but my second point of this discussion now is that everything is intelligent and and I can include not just you know humans and non-human life in that but but um things that we don't often include consider as sentient like ecosystems rocks um the the components of the universe because of intelligence is relational then it can exist between all kinds of bodies and beings um but the point is that you don't start from a position of going like are you intelligent you assume that intelligence and then you look for how it might animate and and and and allow us to learn something about the world um fundamentally you approach other beings and instead of saying like in what way are you like me you ask what is it like to be you like how is your experience creating a world and then perhaps we can find some kind of overlaps between the worlds because all these multiple words that all different beings and organisms inhabit where are the the overlap points when we might actually be able to have some kind of communication or interest and so building on those overlaps and perhaps you're sort of your sort of introduction resources you're moving from artificial intelligence or sort of expertise of digital or knowledge or digital and artificial intelligence in sort of ecological issues You're Something in the case about how about how those of artificial intelligence and the digital Technologies can be used to help understand other forms of intelligence how so um I mean to be clear at the moment they're not particularly and we can talk about the reasons why not um but but I find it very striking that there's something that seems to have happened a few times in the kind of history of of human knowledge making that have required us to essentially build almost like toy little versions of the world before we kind of come into a kind of Greater awareness of already existing so my kind of go-to example of this is um is the relationship between like artificial networks and biological networks as they exist out in the world um I'm sure many people here listening to this have heard of um uh the extraordinary networks that we Now understand underly forests for example uh where you have these extraordinary systems in which um trees of all kinds of species are linked together through mycorrhizal networks fungal networks under the ground um these networks connect trees of different species beyond beyond the immediate kin and they allow um you know not allow nutrients to be passed between them so that deciduous trees pass you know nutrients to the conifers when they're shading them in the summer and the conifers return the favor in the winter um but also they pass information they if a tree is attacked by insects or something and the um you know the warning signals can be sent through this network so that other trees can start to release like chemical defenses before the end um insects get there so it's this extraordinary Vibrant Community of information and material sharing that's going on within forests right under the ground and we're only recently becoming aware of it um it's a striking when that the first pieces of that research were being published kind of in the 1980s and early 90s um there was a very famous issue of of nature the scientific journal that was published in which they published they did a kind of special issue about this and these discoveries and on the cover of the paper and the cover of that issue of the journal uh they called it a wood Wide Web right um this term that's now become quite famous for describing it um the internet and these these networks are not the same thing um they perform all kinds of things differently but they have this kind of metaphorical really important metaphorical quality um that's linked together um and and it's pretty explain to me that the not only did they choose that as a name because they they knew that people reading the journal had a mental model of networks from using computers um that would help them to understand the forest Networks but also that the the scientists who made the first you know researchers first understandings of of the Woodward web were also of course some of the first people to be connected to the internet are given that metaphor because academic scientific institutions were some of the first places to be connected to the internet and that Association continued in all kinds of ways when you know the internet was being very intensively studied in the 1990s as a as a technological object um it gave birth to a new um kind of mathematical discipline a new topological discipline uh called uh called Network Sciences which is basically a new way to understand networks Because the Internet didn't function like previous networks um uh you know it um it's it's what's called scale free which means it can grow and grow and grow and you can take bits out and put them back and it'll kind of root around damage and and nodes can have different strengths of connections and that was all new we'd never seen a network like this before except of course we had and that was the underground tree networks that despite not being at the network I also scale free networks and that we were able to analyze and understand better because we developed this mathematics for the internet so this is weird parallel process going on and to bring it back to your question this is the reason I think this this is to me the most interesting thing about AI is that just perhaps you know we are so focused on intelligence in this form because it's sort of necessary to our understanding of it as ultimately quite blinkered and selfish anthropos unable to quite see beyond their own limits most of the time to kind of construct this toy version of intelligence in order to like parse out certain questions and understand things about it in order to see the rest of the world because one of the most striking things about artificial intelligence is that again whatever it is in the moment um is that despite Our Kind of Science fictional assumption that artificial intelligence is just a kind of human intelligence Plus or artificial general intelligence or you want to call it most of what we see in the world is actually radically unlike human intelligence it's like it's just a different kind of intelligence there's a different way of doing intelligence which brings us back to what we were saying earlier which is that there are multiple ways of doing intelligence we haven't been paying enough attention to all the other ones but even this one that we've created ourselves seems to be doing something different and if there's human intelligence and machine intelligence um and that those are different things then there are more than two there are more than one way and almost certainly more than two ways and in fact probably infinite ways of doing intelligence and so artificial intelligence this entirely human creation becomes like an opening by which we can start to pay attention to all the other intelligences that surround us and you mentioned about sort of human and artificial Integrity around just two subcategories of some intelligence and Nest has done lots of work on sort of collective intelligence which is upbringing the intelligence of machines and people together at scale um we've got a sort of Center for collector intelligence design what's your sort of take on this idea of collective intelligence yeah I mean again it's sort of part of or connected to the idea of multiple forms of doing intelligence right um uh you know intelligence can be Collective or multiple in in kind of many ways and it just gets really interesting as again because just like this different way of doing it so you can you can look at collective intelligence within individual beings for example you can look at the way octopuses do intelligence um which is where they have um you know bundles of neurons in fact like up to half of that what we would call brain tissue running throughout the whole bodies and that their limbs contain neurons that appear to allow those limbs to operate separately from the central nervous system or that that knowledge is they go off and do something over here and then they kind of reconnect and vote or something and we're not entirely sure we don't know what it's like to be an octopus but they appear to be confederated intelligences within a single body and or you have the remarkable information processing capabilities of a swarm of bees for example um the fact that you know we've known for a while that the b share uh knowledge through the waggle dance this little um amazing wiggle bumming little dance that they do to tell other bees of the hive where and flowers are so they'll fly out find nectar come back and then they'll do this dance which tells the other bees how far away and what angle to the sun uh to fly in or to go and get more of this nectar um but they also do that as part of a voting Democratic process um where you know if they're looking for a new um site in which to take the swarmony nesting site they'll go and find that and they'll come back and they'll dance for location um but other bees will be dancing their own locations as well and so that they will um uh gradually sometimes over days integrate this information in much the same way that we understand our brains to integrate information from kind of multiple sources this allows for like very complex decision-making process to occur again a form of collective intelligence in this case taking form between you know multiple members of single species and yeah so um when I think it gets really really interesting um is when of course you have that kind of cooperation happening across species and you have like these radical the different ways of thinking that might be working together and we're seeing this in some applications of artificial intelligence for example and again I'm I don't think this is the most interesting example but it's a very handy way of explaining it um human intelligence tends to be somewhat directed because in the sense that we can't help but have what essentially hunches um we like um you know we have an idea of a subject and where a solution might be found to a problem and we tend to concentrate our resources on that area and we're quite bad if we think something's important over here about looking over here to see if there might be something else altogether artificial intelligence in certain formations won't do that right it'll kind of spiral out in a completely different search pattern of this kind of possible solution space and so what happens is when you have those two things combined um really weird things happen in the book I wrote about and something called the optometrist algorithm which is used in nuclear fusion research which is exactly this you have the incredibly complex set of parameters for an experimental Fusion reactor um uh in which essentially not even an AI just quite a complex algorithm like sets a bunch of possible parameters runs that and then shows a subset of those results to a human who follows this kind of hunch driven it's simplified but way of thinking to like pick out which way to go next and so they explore the problem space together in a way that the human or the machine alone wouldn't do um I think that has immense kind of interesting possibilities for the future one of the most interesting things happening in human governance at the moment for me is these things called citizens assemblies um certain assemblies another really good example of collective intelligence systems assemblies are try and keep this brief um forms of democratic assembly in which instead of people being voted in or kind of selected for their particular set of expertise um people are randomly selected from across the population very famous and very interesting successful one of these has been running in Ireland for the last few years but there's examples of them uh all over Europe and and increasingly further afield now um um and what what happened I used the Irish example is that a hundred people were selected at random for the population so from the whole of the voter rolls and they were basically put in a big hotel for a bunch of weekends and asked to explore some of the most complex naughty problems that the nation faced um things like what to do about an aging population uh what to do about the ecological crisis in Ireland particularly um uh what policy to take on abortion this was the actual the form of assembly that led to the referendum that overturned the the abortion ban in Ireland happened is that in almost every case in which these systems assemblies took place is that not only did like this hundred random people from all kinds of backgrounds come to like consensus around like which is almost impossible thing for us to imagine in like the times we live in which sort of characterized by this division they would come to these consensus and they census would be radical beyond what politicians thought were possible they would come up with new ideas um and and ways of implementing them um and it's an example of collective intelligence that specifically comes from having many different ways of thinking about subject because the reasons one of the ways in which citizens assemblies differ from traditional assemblies is they're not voted in so you don't have like a political class doing this and they're not composed of people who already is recognized as being experts in this so you don't have this kind of expert class both of which may be useful in certain situations but are not terribly good at coming up with the new kind of you know ways of thinking about things that we're all very aware that we need and what happens is you get people from a wide variety of different backgrounds and experiences think about a bit like people are differently embodied but you know towards their environment and that produces radically new ideas and you know one thing that we desperately need to think about is a how we do more of that well there's more of this collective intelligence more of people bringing people of you know meaningfully diverse radically diverse backgrounds together to think in you about subjects but also how we extend that Beyond human intelligence and we and we start to think about what role non-human intelligence has to play in those kind of decision making and thinking processes as well and that'll be a really sort of interesting topic to dive into what does it work um if you have a world where sort of not you have acknowledge non-human intelligence and this I've engaging in politics what might that look like what are are there some practical ways that might manifest it's really hard to see at the moment as well but there are all kinds of kind of suggestions for um for this most of which do tend to involve essentially having someone kind of speaking for non-humans because that's the kind of the hard problem here um the you know Bruno's suggestion of the parliament of things which are kind of popular in environmental models for for a very long time the idea that essentially you would have people Representatives within a um um a parliament or whatever whose job was to kind of speak for the non-humans um I think we're starting to try and imagine ways that might work better than that um uh but like an absolute foundation for it before you get into the thorny questions of like how do you speak to plants or animals in in a more direct way is actually how they how they are recognized and given standing um how how uh how are they given essentially equal rights um because that is the kind of fundamental basis for this like we cannot hope to address the ecological crisis while we still see humans as being utterly Superior to everything else on the planet because that's precisely the situation that's caused um uh the the situation we find has happened at the moment that we've considered humans to be superior and thus we can take and extract and do everything else we want to the planet um for me the the idea of political formations across species is an practically we're still working out to do it um culturally of such foundational importance that we have we have to recognize uh yeah the status respect that needs to be accorded to other beings and are interdependence um the fact that actually the destruction of um other species and of other ecologies is the destruction of our own ecologies and and what we depend upon so this is really really interesting talking to you I'm now going to turn to some questions from um our audience some of which were Post in advance we've got one from Jesse Thompson um he says there seems to be genuine enthusiasm and hope about the possibilities around inter-species internet which I think is something you touched on the book um and potential positive impact of working um with sensor data now do you still feel that way that way since writing the book and are there any other initiatives or approaches you'd want to include there's um you've since learned about if you're writing it again um oh that's really good Mitty questions um yeah so the internet of animals or the inters species internet for those who aren't familiar with it is is essentially the idea that um we should expand our this kind of numeral Network we call the internet um to you know in whatever form it takes to to non-humans in various ways uh let me give you an example of a really amazing internet of animals project that I really love um which came out of um extensive work around animal tracking um uh it's a project called the ecos project it comes out of the Max Planck institutes in in Germany and what they did was um they essentially um they attached um little accelerometer sensors uh to a whole host of animals cows uh goats sheep pigs uh dogs I don't think pigs actually anyway uh and a couple of sites in Italy and these accelerometer tags they stream data about the animal's activity via an antenna on the International Space Station back down to Earth where it's all recorded um and a couple of these sites were on the slopes of Manhattan and uh in the village of lakila two earthquake hot spots and they realized that um by analyzing the data of how um active the animals were they could predict earthquakes with more accuracy and further ahead than any other method we've developed right um uh which is astonishing and Brilliant um and it's something that's you know being attested to in folk knowledge for a long time the animals sort of behaved weirdly oh at her throats but we didn't really have any way of making use of that knowledge and now we do uh um and crucially there's several crucial things about it one of which is like we don't have to understand the mechanism um we still don't know how these animals have this sense uh how they're aware of it even having how they're even aware of having the sense if that makes sense uh but it doesn't matter like we can just listen to them and pay attention to what they're communicating and act on it without having to understand it or break it down in this kind of classically scientific way I can trust them to tell us what we need to trust um and um uh you know this this is you know and this is being used these kind of techniques to understand animal Migration better for example so that you know uh tags on kind of large herds of um deer and Antelope in North America are used to um make changes to planning law for example where to build underpasses so that animals don't get killed on highways this kind of thing and that if you think about it is a kind of involvement of non-humans in the political process because you're essentially giving them a kind of vote on our infrastructural systems you're saying that their voices at least their needs and desires matter when it comes to how humans arrange our lives so I think there's this amazing possibility for in things like the internet of animals to um to play this kind of role though of course there's a bit of me that Still Remains deeply suspicious of the idea that just by sticking like surveillance tags on everything we it's very easy to fall back into the kind of Illusion of control um that that we as humans have in these kind of situations oh if only we knew more if only we could gather more data we'd somehow like you know understand this situation and be able to totally control it to dominate it which is the which is our kind of you know original sin that's left us to this place um and I do raise those doubts a little bit in the book and I still have them um and I guess what you know what might have changed in my my feelings about that is that I don't feel that's any less important um I guess I've just been strengthened in my um uh my beliefs and feelings about other ways of communicating with the world around us that actually we have like a deeply innate ability to commune with the world that has largely been severed um or at least very much suppressed by but in society by capitalism by the technologies that we use um that it is possible to regain and re-access once again um and that it doesn't require all of this kind of technological apparatus it just requires kind of openings one's Consciousness to the world a little bit more and paying a little bit more attention to it um and that's you know much more personal and doesn't belong um within this kind of scientific discourse and it's so vitally important that we are capable of kind of holding a scientific rationality framework for understanding the world on the one hand while understanding that most of the world escapes that Framing and that we need other ways of accessing it and thinking about it as well and that that was required of us is this kind of ability to to modulate between these positions one which says that yes we can take actions based on scientific Frameworks and understanding of the world but one in which it also acknowledges um framing of the world that don't fit into that particularly you know as non-western scientific ones that the plurality of knowledges and approaches the world um that will um yeah the contain all kinds of knowledge as well obviously and what are some of those other ways or the ones that are particularly sort of interested you or I think will be particularly fruitful there are other ways of understanding the world that is um so there's a scientist who I wrote about in um in the book called Monica Galliano who's very very interesting work um and she um she's best known within the kind of scientific Community for a series of really fascinating experiments um uh on Plants uh the most famous of which is how experiments with plant memory uh where she took these Mimosa plants little plants that kind of curl up when you touch them so they're really good to see what how quickly not to see that you know a reaction occurring and she put them on a rail and she dropped them just like 10 centimeters and so they curl up standard she then dropped them a few more times and she noticed that they stopped curling up and I was like oh okay did a few other things like you poke them they still curd up so the um they had somehow understood that um this particular action the fool wasn't dangerous and they'd stopped curling up so they'd learned they'd learned that this particular phenomenon was not a danger it had changed their um uh response as a result not only that she tested them weeks and months later and found the same so they remember they changed they learned they remembered over time they did essentially a bunch of things that when humans do we call it intelligent um and this is pot plants which is quite a radical result that we don't fully understand um but you know keep doing the experiments uh what what what confused or upset quite of other people is that Galliano is also very vocal about um having a shamanic practice um she um uh talks about spending some months of the year uh in South America uh working with traditional knowledge Keepers uh taking various kinds of substances in order to speak directly with plant spirits who have helped design her experiments and if you read her work you really understand how she is working with these plants as collaborators rather than treating them as kind of experimental subjects um and in particular you know again even just phrasing it scientifically it's revolutionary she talks about how you know historically as I've said the the role of Botany has been to kind of chop up a plant into tiny tiny places and regard as a tiny machine rather than seeing it as a whole organism rather than seeing it as like an animal something that has behaviors that has experiences that might be a being and when you start to do that all of this other kind of understanding occurs um and the thing is like if you don't have um that kind of um if you don't if you don't like the shamanic aspect of it doesn't matter because the way she designed to experiment so well that they work within the scientific framework the peer-reviewed um uh reproducible experiments published in in journals and so on and so forth um you can understand these as different ways of understanding the world that get us to not the same but similar places and that can both exist in the world at the same time I struggle with this too I I've taken Ayahuasca one of the one of the um uh substances that Galliano talks about and I have spoken with plant spirits and I have no doubt about their existence um and yet I'm so deeply conditioned in the western ways of thinking myself that I that I second guess and and struggle with that um and and struggle to articulate it even within the kind of discussion that we're having because the discussion that we're having right now is still framed so tightly within these kind of scientific terms of explanation even while I'm critiquing it um I have no trouble despite my difficulty explaining how of thinking of intelligence as something utterly Universal because I have had Direct experience of that and I communicate through various techniques of meditation and fasting hiking up in the mountains for days with non-human beings um that almost doesn't fit within human language let alone human knowledge systems as I understand them but they're Millennia old and they exist across cultures um and and they don't actually um conflict with things that we learn other ways if those things are helpful and useful to us which most of the time should be the criteria in which we base our interest that leads us to a question from Jacqueline bagnall which sort of um speaks of what you're saying and also to a question I sort of raised earlier um where they say if we don't note boundaries between intelligence where do qualifications fit the education industry is based on measuring intelligence what's your take on I imagine it's much much broader but I'm interested to hear uh yeah I mean I think qualifications are important for um skills-based things like you know if I'm I'm about to start building a house um and I'm I'm learning to build at the present moment because I'm going to build it myself as a self-build project but I'm not going to be so stupid just do the wiring entirely myself uh I don't want the house to build down I think there's important like knowledge is when working within certain Frameworks that matter um but I I do feel very strongly and a um the education system that most of us experience at present which is based on those kind of qualifications and testings is completely bunk and totally unfit for purpose and should not exist in anything like the form it does at the moment um we're we're we have been I was educated within it we're still educating within it we've been doing it for Generations forms of Education that seek to instill a certain Paradigm of the world into people and then test them on how well they can regurgitate that Paradigm um rather than teaching them to think or learn or understand the things that will actually be necessary um my my broad understanding you know and this plenty of educational theory I don't think I need just about too much um is that you know the purpose of education is is is to help us to learn the things that we need to learn when we encounter them um not to uh kind of try and um predispose people to any any particular system or to fit in with any external idea of what is valuable particularly what we have at the moment which is this education system based around you know getting people jobs um It's a larger discussion but uh no um like very specifically intelligence testing is completely rubbish um because it all it does is it picks one model of intelligence of which there are multiple and and uses that as the framework for everything but I think you can extend that metaphor to to larger systems of Education based on kind of grading um uh you know sets of knowledge rather than teaching critical ways of thinking and understanding the world amazing to a slightly different topic there's a there's a few questions here from Robin Bergman which seem interrelated um ones what was about do you think intelligence is darwinian but also there's sort of what is your take on on an evolutionary affordances compared to intelligence and another one on evolutionary affordances um not entirely sure what that means but I will try and give one answer which is that one of my favorite writers is um uh is the kind of anthropologist and later ecologist Gregory Bateson um and uh he has a very interesting take on um uh intelligence in its relationships kind of darwinian theory in history um he sort of views Darwin as actually being you know has having done this kind of incredible um damage to our Notions of thinking and relating um because when Darwin framed evolutionary theory and this has been propounded by the worst way by a lot of his followers and the kind of um darwinian kind of movements um he framed the individual whether that's the individual being or the individual species as being the kind of unit of survival within the framework of evolution so that we see we draw these kind of tight lines down family trees or through this species tree of like these totally separate remote um strands of evolution um and Bateson says this is nonsense because the univ the unit of survival is not the individual it's the it's the ecology um the unit of survival is is he says man plus environment human plus plus context um uh the unit of survival is is an entangled thing that contains Us and other beings as well so it's completely ridiculous to talk about Evolution as being like this you know fight between different species or between different individuals because what you actually have is complex interrelationships between different ecologies that survive or die together um and so um you know but what what bateson's also extraordinary move that he makes at that point is to is to connect that to thinking as well um that thinking in his reading is something that happens across species boundaries as well like what I talk about when I talk about embodied and relational thinking um he says what what thinks is the human plus the environment as well right that we are you know and so there is this very close relationship between um ecology as a kind of healthy um bodily relationship um involving nervous systems and immune systems and you know it's very permeable but permeable boundary that actually exists between us and everything around us and our capacity to think in terms of networks that that Sean of ecological networks we're also incapable of thinking at all um and and that has and again that's mirrored back in like new understandings of evolution and things like horizontal Gene transfer which also completely muddle all of these lines that we draw between ourselves that in fact doesn't even really appear to be such a thing as species that appears to have been misnamed so all of these all of these distinctions all of these lines are falling and and the thinking that becomes possible as they do is kind of to me what's interesting we've got a question here for us as you mentioned in the intelligence is embodied how does that square with AI is just another form of intelligence presumably it it not being embodied in the sense that your eye might be yeah it's a really critical way of thinking about it um one of the things I talk about in the in the book is um what I call corporate intelligence and what I mean by corporate intelligence is um uh well really the kind of forms of AI we have at the moment but also the full you know understand those forms of AI aren't just these computer programs we hear about all the time another way to think of an artificial intelligence is a corporation right um a corporation a large business Enterprise is a collective intelligence composed both of those who you know man uh people are employed by so I should say that that company um uh but it has you know a corporation has sensors and effectors right it can it can affect the world in various ways it can sense the world in various ways um it has it's sensitive to like profit and loss changes its response in different ways um it's it's it has legal standing um you can sue a corporation a corporation could sue other people it has uh it has free speech corporate speech is protected so you can understand a corporation as a kind of organism a non-human organism an artificial organism and therefore is an artificial intelligence um so you can think of Corporations as being AIS and I think that's quite a useful thing to do um particularly when trying to understand how to kill them um uh but you can also therefore think of trying to understand quite a lot of the AI that we have at the moment as being a corporate AI because it is embodied these intelligences are embodied in a certain way just their bodies are computer networks and the terminals that we use to interface with them and the environment in which they grow up which is largely the kind of you know tech companies which have a very specific culture and a very particular view on the world they have a kind of libertarian flavor to them because they've grown up in a Libertarian world that's their kind of evolutionary niche so of course they're embodied radically differently to us um and relatively differently to almost all life on this planet but they are in a sense embodied they have an environment they're part of an ecology and that environmental ecology determines how they think and act and actually so thinking about them from that perspective explains quite a lot about them and how to think about them it starts to be clear why so much of the framing around AIS so deeply competitive for example for a long time all the AI we heard about was all these AIS that would beat us at chess and then beat us a go and now they're trying to beat us at like art and and writing movie scripts um and it's in part because that particular form of artificial intelligence and again it's just one particular way artificial intelligence might manifest emerges from a financialized capital world that sees being intelligent as winning at all costs right as as a factor of profit and loss and dominating the competition um if you look a little bit beyond that you can start to see what what AI might look like if it didn't emerge from such like a narrow idea of what intelligence is you have initiatives like indigenous AI you have kind of first other kind of artists created things that are doing more interesting approaches for these that don't embody those things but but that the embodiment is is always there and we've got talking stuff corporations we've got another question here um again from Jacqueline and um says citizens assemblies will be a valuable way to explore the ethicality of our application would this be a viable form of corporate governance um yeah I mean there's been a call in this this like all these recent questions about AI ethics for Citizens assemblies to be deployed um I I really hope the discourse around citizens assemblies doesn't get captured by this kind of like AI question in some way um but I would I would say that citizens assemblies are a very good way of approaching all kinds of problems and i would support their use but I don't think the AI ethics question is necessarily the most important one we should be concentrating on right now um um or at least it could be framed slightly more broadly and perhaps the citizens assembly would do that um I think it's you know it's the there's a thing I guess I didn't say about the citizens of somebody's earlier that I think is really important that um people come out of them differently um uh like when you go through a Citizens assembly process part of that is experts are involved but in a kind of like um educative position where they speak to the participants and help them understand some of the issues without like determining the outcomes but that means that by participating these kind of democratic processes people increase that agency in response to the kind of complex problems that we face as well as coming up with the kind of solutions we have um and I think what's really important to um think about these processes is that not think of any of them including anything I'm talking about about like a better education process or a better way of relating to the world unless we think of it as an ongoing process out of which we you know different possible worlds emerge um uh and we don't know quite what those look like yet um but it absolutely requires us to yeah to to enter these processes with the expectation um that we will be kind of changed and perhaps troubled in interesting ways by the outcomes and you're obviously sort of skeptical of a sort of a corporate sort of capitalist approach the world we've got a question here from Ignacio Gutierrez Gomez I have an iPhone pronounced that correctly um it says I was wondering how we can use these other forms of knowledge non-human without making the commodity or financialized and not transforming it only is aware of economic growth is that possible yeah I mean I think it's absolutely possible um and it just requires coming from a totally different starting point um you know one of the um uh uh the examples I mentioned earlier uh of uh indigenous AI is a is a system um being developed by uh largely by uh Maori speakers in New Zealand uh for looking at uh for developing translation algorithms using machine learning that remain within the community that is banned from being sold to the outside so that the benefits of that only accrue to the community and and I know that's not a non-human example that you asked for um but um but I but the the reason I bring it up is that um these things will non-coupled non-financial kind of uses of these things will emerge when they are made by people in communities that are not interested in profiting from them in this way which is why the first step towards them is kind of diversifying knowledge of how of this album that sounds so like paternalistic the knowledge exists already out there and um and in vast ways of people and it's about um uh listening to those forms of knowledge uh and uh not presuming that there is something that we have to build upon them so it sounds a bit confused but I like I really I don't want to speak for communities of knowledge that I that are not my background or my history in particular um but uh if the simple answer is there are other ways of being in this world that don't involve submission by Capital then yes absolutely they exist um and like everything else um they're just kind of waiting to be to be given given strength attention we've got another question here from and she's asking how would you take the insights from your research and apply it to making governments more intelligent well um uh I'm not really one for governance uh myself very much so it's a difficult um question as I said like you know um I'll look at citizens assemblies uh the the main way governments become more intelligent is is through collective intelligence diversity intelligence and devolving power uh to those who um who who are considered to be governed but not really given a choice in that government um intelligence uh is never going to reside within single entities in the way that current systems of government presumes that it does um and therefore the more in which ways in which um decision making power can be um devolved to more diverse and more numerous collectives uh the better really and that's that's I mean that's that's attested too by plenty of social sciences research including you know all the stuff that's gone in systems assemblies and another and other systems um I yeah yeah that's what I have to say about that I think um there are there are Pathways towards that um and uh and uh some of them are top down like the establishment of Citizen assemblies and a lot and and more though they really bottom up you don't change the government by by changing the government uh you change the government by changing the culture uh that produces that government and is happy or not with it um uh but both directions help I think we've got time to fit in one's a final question and this is from Ike over worry uh and this has received a lot of certain media attention and I'd be interesting you're taking it do you think that artificial intelligence will overthrow human intelligence at some point I suppose a question for me is is that the right way of thinking about it yeah um like it comes out of discussion of what do we mean by artificial intelligence um and there's a few things to understand there I think for me um one of which is that what we currently call artificial intelligence at the present like actually existing artificial intelligence is nothing of the kind right it's just like some really powerful computers and as I said before it's powerful computers of one particular kind um uh you know when I studied AI 20 years ago now badly we were studying much the same techniques these things called neural networks that go back much further to like connectionism of the 1960s they're still the main technique that underlies AI models today the difference the thing that's actually happened in the last 20 years is not it's not some major breakthrough in how we think about AI or what we imagine intelligence can do uh what has happened is that um large technology companies have spent 20 years uh building incredibly powerful computers uh uh vast sums of money as a result based on uh taking like all of the data of human culture our own lives our knowledge is our history our sciences and you know ramming them into these machines that are now kind of selling something back to us that's not artificial intelligence that's um uh what um the science fiction writer Ted oh whatever Ted surname is uh in a recent piece called like it's applied statistics um it's not intelligent um it's kind of um it's just it's power and it's primarily capitalist power and it's primarily money power um and so pretty much any any headline that says you know is AI going to do this you just replace AI with capitalism because there's no problem of AI in the present moment that isn't a problem with capitalism it's if it's worried about taking our jobs if we're worried about subsuming us in various ways well it's just doing that because there's money in it and that's the system that we're in um I don't think there's a meaningful either to the idea the science fictional idea that is neither less useful to think about about artificial general intelligence somehow supplanting us right we are part of an economy what we are part of an economy but what I meant to say was we're part of an Ecology of intelligences in which ecology is in which intelligences work together think together sometimes think against each other um but in which we're all like deeply deeply entangled and the Very idea that one might come to dominate us is based on the deeply false idea that the universe is based on domination that somehow there is any kind of hierarchy to us and it's specifically it's based on the historic idea that humans are smarter better than everything else we're not we have certain affordances and a birth rate uh and certain other things that have allowed us to dominate this planet uh and that won't continue very long if we continue with that belief because we are destroying the ecology on which we utterly depend um that's the opposite of intelligence that's the dumbest thing we could possibly do it how unintelligent we are that we would destroy the ecosystem on which Our Lives depend um there is no hierarchy of intelligence nothing will come to dominate us we might however destroy much of the world before we come to acknowledge that and and to be honest we don't need ai's help in doing that well I suppose I I I totally agree and thank you so much for a really really interesting discussion it's provider a lot of food for thought and I hope everyone in the audience has found it useful as well I understand that James's book is in all major bookstores so if you want to find it then I can heartily um recommend it I've got a copy here blurring allows myself to show that um so now I've reached the end of the event I'll be really grateful of those joining the audience could please fill in a short survey um the link will be shared in the chat and also be available on the events description as a thank you for filling out the survey you'll be entered into a prize draw for a 50 pound bookshop.org voucher uh and if you haven't already please sign up to nestor's newsletter uh I'm gonna let you know about other events coming up so all it leads me to do is say thank you so much to Joan so that's a fascinated discussion now to be honest I wish I could talk to you all afternoon versus that you don't have time and identify audiences either but thank you very much indeed and thank you everyone else for joining us thank you very much cheers [Music]
