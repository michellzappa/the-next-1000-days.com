mitigation policy across the energy sector and in climate related AI policy Lord is all yours guys I'm gonna stop sharing right now your muted Priya hello everyone um and welcome to today's lecture on tackling climate change with machine learning so climate change is one of the most pressing issues that we as a society are facing today and we're already seeing its effects from storms to droughts to fires to flooding these impacts are being felt globally and they are disproportionately being felt by the world's most disadvantaged populations which creates a huge imperative to act quickly on this issue in particular according to the UN intergovernmental panel on climate change or ipcc we as a society need to hit Net Zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 in order to avoid some of the worst effects of climate change and this is going to require a rapid transformation across virtually every sector of society so energy transport buildings Agriculture and so forth so given this huge imperative to act on climate change one might ask the question you know how does machine learning fit into this picture during today's lecture we'll aim to give an overview of some answers to this question so we'll start with a brief introduction to climate change followed by an overview of the ways in which machine learning can play a role in climate action and then important considerations for research and deployment while the majority of this lecture will focus on how machine learning can Aid in climate action it's worth noting that machine learning is a general purpose technology that can have both good and bad effects so we'll dive a little bit into this broader picture as well and finally we'll close with some takeaways and tips on how to get involved so first an introduction to climate change since the next lecture after this one is fully focused on an intro to climate change I'm just going to focus on the highlights here so the Earth has already warmed over one degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels as human activities have put an excess of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere so like carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide this warming in turn has induced major changes in the climate or the average weather over 10 to 30 years and we're seeing increased Extremes in terms of phenomena like heat waves precipitation droughts and hurricanes every unit of greenhouse gas emissions we put into the atmosphere adds further to this warming of the earth and the subsequent changes in the climate in particular this plot from the ipcc shows how much more warming we can expect depending on how rapidly it we Act the takeaway is that the faster we act the less warming we'll see so for instance hitting net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 limits warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius a goal that the International Community has agreed will help avoid some of the worst impacts of climate change while this target is important and one we should absolutely aim to hit it's also worth noting that it's not an on off switch in the end every unit of greenhouse gas emissions we avoid putting into the atmosphere will reduce the extent to which the Earth warms so how do we actually address climate change there are several different axes of action here as well as important Frameworks that underpin these actions the first axis of action is climate science so climate science entails the study of the Earth the ocean and cryosphere and the atmosphere in order to understand and predict the extent to which the climate will change this can then help guide what we should do about it this area of climate science will be covered in much more depth during day three of the summer school the second axis of action is climate change mitigation which means preventing emissions and reducing atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations in order to reduce the extent to which the climate actually changes to understand climate change mitigation strategies it's worth noting that greenhouse gas emissions come from many different sectors as shown by the plot on the slide and now by the list of sectors that I've just thrown up and accordingly strategies to reduce emissions need to also span all these different sectors there are different strategies to reduce emissions in these different sectors so for example for energy-based sectors like energy Supply transport buildings and Industry we can use something called the Kaya identity to conceptualize the ways in which we can reduce emissions in these sectors so by reducing consumption or improving efficiency or switching to clean energy you'll learn more about the Kaya identity during day eight of the summer school with different days focused on deep dives into each of these sectors for agriculture forestry and other land use-based sectors emissions result from a combination of land use changes fertilizer use and livestock and you'll learn more about strategies for reducing those emissions during day five of the summer school focused on agriculture forestry and other land use the third axis of action is climate change adaptation so given the effects we are experiencing and that we will experience how do we respond to those to understand that it's worth noting that climate change has some Direct effects which lead to Downstream effects we need to adapt to so these Direct effects of climate change include Rising temperatures and changing precipitation and in addition since oceans have absorbed about 30 percent of the CO2 we've emitted and 90 of the resulting heat increase the water has expanded and the ice has melted causing sea level rise and causing the ocean to acidify this has led to different Downstream effects like droughts and heat waves more intense storms and flooding you know wildfires loss of ecosystem services and biodiversity disease spread and pest spread all of which we need to adapt to so how do we actually deal with these things the first step is by understanding the risks we're actually going to face meaning both the magnitude of impacts and the probability that we'll face them for instance this plot from the ipcc is looking at the expected changes in annual mean precipitation globally at different levels of warming and you can sort of quantify the risk as the impact times the probability of an adverse event once you know what these risks look like the separate second step is strengthening adaptive capacity against this these risks this involves building both robustness to potential outcomes so for example making sure your power grid doesn't black out when there's a big climate-induced storm as well as building resilience so that is if your power grid does go out making sure you can bring it back up more quickly these kinds of strategies need to be applied across human and ecological systems so considering food security water security resilient infrastructure and ecological conservation and have a lot of synergies with for example the UN sustainable development goals these kinds of strategies are going to be covered in depth for adaptation during for example day 6 and 11 of the summer school in addition to these major axes of action so climate science mitigation and adaptation there are several important Frameworks that underpin these actions one is climate Justice which basically notes that the brunt of climate changes impacts will be felt by the world's already most disadvantaged populations and for that and many other reasons Equity needs to be a central consideration in how we approach climate action another of these is a co-benefits framework which notes that it's important to think about climate action holistically and understand how it interacts with other societal priorities like human well-being and ecosystem health throughout the summer school we'll plan to address these considerations as we talk about strategies to act on climate change so to wrap up the main takeaways here are that we need really rapid action to address climate change and these axes of action include climate science mitigation and adaptation doing these strategies right requires thinking holistically so for example considering climate Justice and interactions with the sustainable development goals and many fields and sectors need to be involved in making these kinds of strategies successful so various fields of Science and Engineering economics and the social sciences public policy and so forth and machine learning can play a role in supplementing and strengthening these efforts okay now that we've seen more about what climate change is what its effects are and broadly what's involved in addressing it let's dive into how machine learning specifically can be useful with an overview of the different roles that machine learning can play in climate action as well as considerations to bear in mind when evaluating and prioritizing applications of ml within the climate space a couple of years ago uh Priya Lynn and I along with a multi-disciplinary team of other authors wrote a paper called tackling climate change with machine learning which because it gives a detailed taxonomy and Analysis of the different ways that machine learning can be used in climate action in the full paper we identified opportunities for ML to play roles across different areas and sectors from electricity systems buildings transportation to land use climate prediction and societal adaptation while there isn't time here to go through all these applications I want to highlight a few themes we identified for the kinds of impact that ml can have which cut across different areas of application I'll go into each of these themes with examples in the next few slides distilling raw data into actionable information optimizing complex systems improving predictions accelerating scientific discovery and approximating time-intensive simulations okay let's dive into the First theme there are many ways in which ml can help at Advance climate action by taking some huge raw data set and going through it to pick out actionable information which might be too slow or cumbersome for a human to do at scale often in these situations the raw data is a set of images for example satellite or aerial imagery or a corpus of text and so computer vision and natural language processing are often relevant one example of where this role for ML comes up is in mapping deforestation in real time increasingly machine learning is being used to parse satellite images to work out where forests are being cut down for agriculture Timber or mining this can be valuable in guiding policy decisions as well as interventions in cases where forests are protected mapping deforestation is also useful for verification in carbon markets where landowners get financial benefits if they can prove that they're conserving their land mapping carbon stock is a related task where ml for remote sensing is also being used this means quantifying the amount of carbon that's stored in a forest a grassland or another area of land in order to better determine the value from an emissions perspective of preserving that land another setting in which ml is being used to parse raw satellite data is in gathering information on buildings there's very little publicly available info about what buildings are where and how much energy they use which makes it difficult to shape policies using computer vision it's possible to approximate the footprints and Heights of buildings from which their energy use can in turn be approximated now these are both examples of tools for climate change mitigation reducing greenhouse gas emissions that's why I put a little m in Brackets there now we can look at some examples also from adaptation responding to the effects of climate change ml has been used for example to correct errors in global elevation Maps so as to point out pinpoint Coastal communities there are at risk from flooding um by working out the exact Heights of different areas these algorithms have made it possible to determine that hundreds of millions more people are at risk than had been previously thought as an example from natural language processing NLP there's a lot of information in corporate Financial disclosures that can be useful in informing climate policy decisions for example what risks companies anticipate from climate change training topic modeling algorithms to pick out relevant passages has sped up the process of finding this information overall we've seen ml algorithms can be very useful in distilling big raw data sets into actionable information that can guide policies or other kinds of decisions moving on to our second theme let's consider settings in which ml can help operate complex automated systems more efficient a wide variety of algorithms can be relevant here from classic optimization techniques to reinforcement learning NL is being used to control heating and cooling systems more efficiently so that they use less power this is true both for smart thermostats and personal homes and also in the more challenging cases of large buildings and Industrial processes increasingly ml is being used to help optimize Transportation schedules for example the Train the timetable at the German Railway operator Deutsche Bahn incorporates ml uh this can also help in allowing different modes of Transport like trains and buses or trucks to interface smoothly for public transportation and Freight ml can also be used to guide demand response in which certain activities that require electricity but are flexible on when that electricity is used like charging an electric car or running a dishwasher can be times to occur when there's a surplus of power or when it's coming from low carbon sources now note that in situations where ml is being asked to optimize a system the objective function is very important in particular it's not always aligned with climate action for example reducing cost may end up reducing greenhouse gas emissions but not always it's also worth noting that making a process more efficient can sometimes increase the amount that people use it this is called a rebound effect and it can diminish the savings once gets from improved efficiency moving on to our next theme ml can be helpful in improving predictions and forecasts across many different application areas a variety of Time series analysis techniques can be relevant here including in Bayesian methods and sometimes computer vision techniques and settings with image-based data as an example on an electrical grid the power being generated needs to match the power being consumed at each point in time also fuel power plants can largely be controlled to vary the amount of power being generated but for solar and wind the power being generated varies from minute to minute depending on the sun and wind conditions ml is starting to be used to forecast how much wind and solar power will be available including by using historical time series data and satellite imagery of clouds this makes it possible to use more wind and solar and less powerful fossil fuels similarly ml is being used to forecast the amount of demand for electrical power from time series data the UK's National Grid recently implemented ml algorithms that cut in half the error in their power demand forecasts as another example is 10 relevant adaptation ml is being used to help forecast crop yield from satellite images in response to the threat climate change poses to Agriculture and food security our next theme is accelerating scientific discovery there are many settings in which new materials or other Technologies can advance climate action but the process of perfecting such Tech takes huge amounts of experimentation in some cases ml can speed up the process not by removing the need for physical experimentation but by helping design new experimental setups such algorithms can include generative models Active Learning and reinforcement learning and where chemical compounds are concerned often involve graph neural networks in the case of materials design ml can be used to learn from the outcomes of past experiments to suggest promising new materials this can be valuable in the design of new compounds from batteries photovoltaic cells and catalysts used in green energy applications as another example reinforcement learning methods recently developed that can effectively control Plasma in experiments on nuclear fusion which is a potential future source of low carbon energy now for our final theme let's turn to the ways in which ml is used to approximate simulations physics-based simulations turn up in many climate relevant areas and while calculations based on known physical laws are highly accurate they can also be slow and ml can be used to produce faster approximate answers relevant ml methods can include physics-informed techniques computer vision and interpretable or causal methods as one example climate models are complex ensembles of physics-based simulations how variables like temperature and precipitation behave around the globe these models can take months to run even on powerful computational infrastructure even then climate models normally operate at relatively coarse spatial resolution like hundreds of kilometers since higher resolution could be prohibitively computationally expensive however that limits the utility of these models in informing local measures for climate adaptation ml-based super resolution techniques are therefore being used to increase the spatial resolution of certain pieces of climate models this is also called down scaling in a totally different setting ml is being used to approximate certain portions of car aerodynamic simulations in order to design more fuel-efficient vehicles and in the power sector ml can speed planning models used to simulate electrical grids which are again based on domain physics and can be extremely slow okay we've seen a number of climate relevant applications of ml across many different sectors and Fields with ML playing roles in distilling data into useful insights optimizing complex systems improving predictions accelerating scientific discovery and approximating simulations if you're interested in further details I encourage you to check out the interactive version of the tackling climate change with ML paper which is available at climate change.ai summaries where you can search for different applications by themes subject area or ml take I want you to go under the hood a bit and talk about the process that we use for evaluating and prioritizing applications when we wrote that paper there were a number of questions that we found to be very useful in shaping our thinking and there's still a useful framework for me when I'm considering a new potential project first is ml needed to address the problem there are many urgent problems related to climate change where ml unfortunately isn't going to be helpful there are also problems that have already been solved without using ML and where the existing solution is perfectly fine what is the scope of the impact you don't have to work on problems that could reduce Mega tons of CO2 more modest gains add up but at the same time working on say reducing plastic straw use might not be the best use of time it's good to have at least a ballpark sense of how meaningful a problem is for climate perspective what is the time Horizon of the impact a ton of CO2 reduced now is much more impactful than a ton of CO2 reducing 30 years since the sooner we can achieve Net Zero the lower the damage this is one reason why planting trees while important is generally a lower priority than preserving the trees we have similarly working on techniques like nuclear fusion which at best or decades away from success and scalability can be valuable but shouldn't distract from nearer term Solutions what is the likelihood that a solution can be found it's very tempting to work on moon shots that have some small probability of huge impact but often it's better to work on problems with a high probability of medium impact also sometimes those Moon shots have a long time Horizon which we've seen as less ideal can a solution feasibly be deployed the best algorithm in the world isn't going to have an impact if nobody uses it sometimes ml works but it isn't scalable in the relevant setting for example because of Hardware costs expertise required to run and maintain it or access to annotated data what are the potential side effects of deploying the candidate solution an optimization algorithm might reduce screen has gas emissions but increase other human costs a system for Gathering data on vulnerable populations could be co-opted by Bad actors depending on the situation it may not be feasible to avoid all negative side effects but where possible they should be recognized up front and mitigated who are the relevant stakeholders who are involved in or affected by the application they may have constraints or requirements that need to be built into any viable solution and it is through their eyes that an approach should be judged finally I'd like to highlight a number of considerations to bear in mind when think about the overall space of ml applications in climate action first remembering that ml is not a silver bullet it's only one of the many tools we need and it's not applicable everywhere it should never replace or distract from other actions involved in fighting climate change second some of the most impactful and interesting applications aren't flashy for instance detecting failures in railroad systems doesn't receive as much press as autonomous driving but from a climate perspective it's probably more beneficial we'll talk more about this later sometimes to find those non-flashy problems you really have to dive deeply into understanding what is needed within a particular area of application third the flashiest methods in machine learning also aren't always needed I'll dive into this point in more detail in a moment when thinking about climate applications of machine learning it's essential to conceive of them as collaborations including both ml experts and domain experts often other stakeholders who are involved in deployment or affected by the technology should be included too these kinds of Partnerships are important to make sure that the algorithms aren't solving the role in the problem and that where possible they leverage domain-specific knowledge Partnerships are also key in shaping a pathway to impactful deployment and ensuring that any deployment relevant considerations are built into the design right from the start lastly Equity considerations are fundamentally important including who is Building Solutions what problems are prioritized and how these problems are worked empowering a diverse and Global set of stakeholders is essential to ensure that Technologies are owned by the people affected by them rather than reinforcing existing power imbalances across countries and institutions related to the question of who is the question of what is being worked on since problem priorities often reflect existing inequities within ML and Technology more broadly for instance ml to fight wildfires which is a key problem in North America Europe Australia tends to receive more attention and funding than ml to fight locusts which affects East Africa the Middle East and India even though both problems are extremely important and are exacerbated by climate change and how problems are worked on is also important data imbalances between regions or between communities within a region can mean ml Solutions are only applicable to a subset of the population or that algorithms are most effective within data rich areas ideally ml for climate will serve to improve Equity this takes active work the level of project design and management now as I noted above while state-of-the-art methods for machine learning can be useful in other cases simpler methods may be enough when shouldn't leap to using Transformers when linear regression will do the trick chat gbt may seem like the cool new thing but in most climate relevant applications it's useless and in some cases it would be actively harmful because it's basically impossible to make it trustworthy where Innovations in machine learning are useful they tend to be motivated not by whatever works the best on standard Benchmark ml data sets but by the needs specific application domains here's some common themes that often turn up in many applications like climate modeling or power grid optimization there are constraints that arise from system physics incorporating energy conservation power flow or the properties of chemical bonds is often hard for standard Black Box ml algorithms but it may be necessary if they all grow if the answers are going to be meaningful in some cases such constraints reflect engineering needs that will lead to system failure if they're violated for example a blackout in the power grid Notions of robustness are also meaningful here though robustness can mean different things in ml and in particular application domains for example robust control algorithms require a notion of lyapan of stability that's quite far from the ml notion of robustness under adversarial perturbation in various situations where ml models are providing information to key stakeholders interpretable predictions are essential both to ensure stakeholder buy-in and to enable algorithmic oversight and accountability causal models of how predictions are made may also be useful building on the increasing set of tools available at the intersection of causal inference in ml in similar settings uncertainty quantification can be very important too generic ml models often have very poorly calibrated uncertainty which can make it very difficult to use ml derived insights in decision making generalization is a common challenge across ML and in climate relevant settings these challenges can take a number of different forms algorithms may be called upon to perform a similar task like land cover classification across geographies where data may be different in ways that require domain transfer and adaptation data may be non-stationary and change over time for example weather patterns varying is the climate changes and data may be limited or imbalanced as with extreme events or long tail distributions of biodiversity data now we talk about all these areas and More in our tutorial for icml 2022 which is available online so if you're interested I'd encourage you to check that resource out awesome so we covered a lot of ground just there in terms of you know the ways in which machine learning can help address climate action and now we want to turn to some important considerations for research and deployment and as a reminder if you have questions throughout this lecture please do drop them in the community platform and we'll get to them at the end of the lecture so in working on machine learning or any technique to address a climate relevant problem it's important to understand the broader Pathway to impact in which the work is situated in particular it's necessary to scope the problem understand what other tools and approaches already exist and understand how the machine learning if it's needed at all will interact with these existing tools and approaches Downstream from the machine learning it's important to understand how the solution will be analyzed and deployed and what other potential consequences or side effects it might have things like rebound effects Equity impacts and so forth and to make sure to incorporate these considerations When developing algorithms in the first place a part of this Pathway to impact involves getting a sense of what data simulators and evaluation metrics may already exist as well as what needs to be created on the data side creating data can entail many different kinds of things depending on what's available so data collection but also annotation or collation or inferring information from proxies or even just figuring out how to properly license data that already exists it's worth noting here that different communities have very different Notions of what data or a data set look like so it's important to work together and calibrate expectations in this respect in addition to static data sets simulators and test beds are particularly important for control and optimization problems on physical domains like power grids buildings and heavy industry and then importantly evaluation metrics are key these metrics should cover what it means for a method to directly be successful but also measure potential side effects or negative consequences or other factors you need to holistically understand the solution developing good metrics involves requires involvement from multiple kinds of stakeholders as well as consistent re-evaluation to make sure the metrics continue to make sense a few resources I'll point out here include the climate change AI data set wish list which poses different kinds of data sets it could be useful to create entities like the Lacuna fund which provide funding for data set creation particularly in low and middle income contexts and the nurbs data sets and benchmarks track which is a potential venue to publish and disseminate data sets to Spur further work when thinking about the impacts of work in the space the broader conversation on responsible AI is also very applicable and it can play out in important ways in climate change related contexts so for example there are many places where data and algorithms can create or perpetuate bias for instance machine learning is used for been building Energy Efficiency retrofits to try to identify which buildings are more likely to succeed in a retrofit for the lowest costs but factors like housing discrimination and generational wealth have affected the current state of which buildings are more efficient now and that means that algorithms trained on this data might replicate these historical inequities and biases we need to focus both on cleaning up the data and on being thoughtful about how the algorithm is used in order to avoid this data on buildings is also an evenly available across geographies and this can potentially bias interventions as well modeling choices can also perpetuate bias so for example physics-based weather models are often calibrated based on observational data and the choice of calibration data affects who the model performs well for so for example there's more sensor data on weather available in Europe than in Africa which means our weather models are almost certainly performing better in Europe than in Africa because of these calibration choices in addition to bias trustworthiness and accountability are also important considerations making sure you can really trust or interpret the outputs of your model especially in you know when making policies or another sensitive contexts and then Equity considerations are of course extremely important considering the intersection of responsible Ai and climate Justice important actions in this area include centering diverse stakeholders so for example not working just with wealthy industrial agriculture stakeholders but also smallholder farmers another is ensuring that Personnel capacity compute expertise and access are not just concentrated within a few institutions and geographies but making sure that they're democratized so that a broad set of stakeholders can participate in and benefit from ml for climate work and another is avoiding digital colonialism which is when those in developed countries use data from developing countries with little involvement from or benefit for the populations whose data is being used so this can be things like exploiting differences in privacy regulations across around personal energy use data or by analyzing satellite imagery from afar without deeply engaging local populations that sort of deep engagement of the people whose data it is is extremely important that can be a lot to keep in mind and so if I had to impart one meta level tip here it would be to work with the correct stakeholders to make sure that these considerations come to the front this includes researchers from multiple disciplines deployment Partners end users policy makers and also other parties who might not be directly involved in deploying the technology but may nonetheless be affected by its deployment or use and importantly it's not just about engagement but in fact meaningful engagement where different stakeholders are really able to drive and shape the progress I'd refer you to this classic stakeholder engagement paper on arnstein's ladder of citizen participation in order to learn more about that so to sum it up when working explicitly on ML for climate problems it's important to understand your how your ml algorithm is situated within its broader Pathway to impact to work on the infrastructure part rather than just the methods part so for example the creation of data simulators and metrics to understand and mitigate any negative Downstream effects and side effects that the work might have and to engage with stakeholders across the entire pathway okay um thanks Priya um we will now um briefly discuss in which ways machine learning can actually be a help or a hindrance for climate action and we will discuss how to think about measuring the carbon footprint of machine learning and what everyone can do also to shape the overall impact of machine learning and more on this topic will come on day nine impacts and regulation of AI and climate change so um we've talked so far about how machine learning can help with addressing climate change but there are also ways that machine learning can potentially hurt the climate and many of you have probably thought about the computational emissions from machine learning and while this is a problem it's not the only way that machine learning can increase emissions in fact machine learning is a multi-purpose technology and it can be applied in ways that both increase and decrease emissions and lastly machine learning also interacts with a larger technological social and economic system and that can be in ways that can help or hinder climate change mitigation and in this part we will talk about all of these aspects in a bit more detail to understand how machine learning affects emissions so um let's start with the emissions from from machine learning computation and Hardware emissions for machine learning training um they differ significantly between the model types and they also depend on whether a model is fine-tuned or trained from scratch and this plot here shows how large the CO2 emissions are from training different models and it Compares those to the emissions from other typical activities such as driving a car for a mile so I noticed a log scale here the most energy intensive model with 6 billion parameters that's listed in this plot emits as much as a powering as powering a typical home for a year on the other side we have the activity of fine-tuning bird which is a common thing to do in practice this is a language model and this compares to consuming less than a liter of gasoline per training run and then what we can also see here in this plot is that the size of the model matters a lot for how much energy is consumed during training so here we have different sizes of the same model the vision Transformer so what the authors of this paper measure here are operational emissions those come from the energy consumed during computation and the way we can address this one factor that's important here is the energy efficient efficiency of the data centers that we're training or doing inference on and the data center efficiency can be improved with more efficient Hardware better cooling or the use of waste heat for heating homes for example it um the emissions also depend on the type of electricity used so using renewable energy improves the carbon footprint considerably and data centers also have this opportunity to help integrate more renewable energy into the grid by providing a load that's flexible but operational emissions are not the only part um they're also the so-called embodied emissions and what do we mean by that so producing computer hardware also emits greenhouse gas emissions and for example this is through Mining and Manufacturing through Transportation or through disposing of unused hardware and this last picture here also illustrates how important our other environmental impact in this picture and social impacts as well so um we will discuss how to measure Computing related emissions for machine learning as a whole in the lecture on day nine so let's take another look at the application impacts of machine learning earlier in this lecture we learned about the different ways that machine learning can be used to reduce emissions which are summarized in this figure and I wanted to highlight one aspect of this figure which is indicated by the red bubble machine learning can also increase emissions for example if it's applied in um the oil gas sector to improve exploration there could help to increase the amount of oil and gas that's extracted and this is actually happening in reality currently there don't really exist Senate ways to measure such application related impacts both in decreasing and increasing emissions this might be actually quite easy for certain case studies for example for Energy Efficiency measures but for others it may actually be quite difficult if you for example if you're using machine learning for battery r d so I wanted to walk you through an example of AI applied for efficiency in crude oil refining to illustrate that there is also the broader scope um a broader scope to consider and um here this is an example where we're actually turning crude oil into lighter hydrocarbons by using heat from Coca units and there's a need to accurately predict the coke buildup in pipes and machine learning can actually considerably help here and um this helps to maintain equipment and reduce the energy consumption so of course this application of machine learning is reducing the emissions in the refinery but what it also does is reducing costs and here we need to consider how the application that is reducing cost of oil products is affecting emissions from the energy and economic system as a whole so you can see that this is trickle-down effects to the system level and this is what we mean with this last point of um that we're making of machine Learning System level impacts so to recap the major categories of ways that machine learning affects emissions is through its computation and Hardware the immediate impacts of its applications both good and bad and the system-wide changes that machine learning can induce so um what can you do um so if you are looking at a computation related emissions there are actually tools that help you measure the footprint that are even sometimes specifically integrated for example into Azure or hugging phase and you can also reduce your impact by choosing more efficient models for example distilled bird instead of bird and reducing wasteful model retraining and execution then regarding what you apply those machine learning algorithms to it's important that you try to quantify and evaluate the application impacts where possible and that you're transparent about the impacts and Publications and with stakeholders there's really a danger to do green washing as well here so um be clear about what you consider the impacts of your application and then ultimately of course you can also choose what you or the machine Learning Community um much broad more broadly works on um so and this last part of our lecture now has um even more takeaways and tips how to get involved into the space so um first of all there are many job opportunities in the space um those are in traditional academically searched institutes startups tech companies but also um consider attack teams in non-tech companies for example in the energy sector there are also jobs connected to the public sector for example funding and data procurement and policy making so if you're working on machine learning you can create include climate relevant applications in a set of problems that motivate your work and it's important that you build those collaborations with domain experts for those areas if you're working on climate related problems you can learn about relevant machine learning methods and build collaborations with machine learning experts as well so um if you're coming from the machine learning and Tech side working explicitly on climate problems isn't always the only way to help you can also think about how to better align your existing projects with climate goals and ultimately I wanted to highlight also that sometimes becoming a bridge between machine learning and a specific sector is an interesting option so for example you're becoming an expert in machine learning and agriculture so um as you are learning you may want to turn to Dedicated communities to get involved and these are often centered around different domains like climate science for example and they often run regular events and if you are working on research and you're looking to publish their workshops at a machine learning conferences and there's a special track of jmlr we have journals like the environment data science journal dedicated to the space ACM compass and then many other domain specific and also general interest venues that people com publish in this area so if you are interested in highlights from these communities and things around research and Industry and policy check out the climate change monthly newsletter so similarly you may actually want to get your hands dirty and try working with data sets or participating in challenges and here likewise and these are often centered around the domains and you can find out uh what community is relevant for your area of interest at the wiki that we have built and climate change Ai and um you can work yourself on these topics um by working through the tutorials that we are also providing on the website so um lastly I wanted to point out that another way to engage with questions around machine learning and climate change is by working with policy makers and many governments are actually looking towards regulating AI currently or even putting programs in place that are dedicated to Ai and climate change and your expertise can be really helpful here so um if you want to involve or be involved in policy making first step is to condense information to make it useful for policy makers um for example you can see here a report that we wrote together with a global partnership on AI and another Main Avenue for input to the policy making process is in form of written feedback to propose legislation legislators often propose like require this kind of feedback from experts and the public since they may not be able to think about all relevant issues as they are designing a law so an example of such requests for feedback is currently open by the office of Science and Technology policy in the US and the explicitly asked for input on how AI may affect U.S greenhouse gas emissions and climate goals and one can submit feedback until July 7. such feedback rounds are typically open to anyone CCI has in the past submitted such a feedback to the EU AI act and this is a another major upcoming regulation of AI that previously didn't include anything regarding regulating ai's environmental and climate impact and um now it's still currently in the process of being discussed and the Parliament has made significant amendments to change that so we're going to talk more about policy on day nine so um this is the final slide where I just I wanted to tell you about all the things that climate change AI does and how we provide you with resources to get started in this area so um we've written a number of foundational reports on climate change and AI um we've mentioned a couple in this lecture and we've provided this Wiki that you can contribute to online um then you're currently participating in one of our events the summer school but we also have a workshop series and large AI conferences and domain conferences then we have a funding program for research projects which is a second iteration at the moment we also provide resources in the form of a newsletter and a Blog and we have this community that you can ask questions on this lecture in we regularly also run webinars and happy hours so there's a way to regularly attend events events and engage with the community and if you want to find out more about how to engage with the space so check out our website and engage with us on social media okay and now the floor is open for questions and we're really looking forward to hearing from you well guys that was an impressive lecture I think you kind of solve all my questions and and that I had but there's a few from the different um from the different uh questions that we have received um there's several questions in regards to features and how how you can actually expand models with additional features um for a specific question uh that was in the time Horizon for the for impact it's do ml models account for Human Society related variables such as political challenges to implementation of nuclear power plants or citizens Behavior attitude towards potential solution and even economic factors and so and the question is angle if these variables are accounted in the models or are they hard to to acquired or implement um so I would say is a it's a really good question uh generally speaking the ml model isn't being asked to something so big picture there's a need to do that it's more a situation of that would be something that would help you decide whether you should be using an algorithm in a certain context ml models normally aren't simulating climate action or something like that they would be be simulating a particular piece of the climate or a particular kind of action that could be taken so one way ml is used in these kind of big you know economic decision making or policy decision-making processes is you'll often write down some kind of you know rule-based model or economic model or something you're trying to solve and then sometimes if that model is overly computationally intensive you can use machine learning to you know approximate parts of that model or otherwise speed up the overall model but in general kind of machine learning to forecast a macro scale decision is is not usually where it's used um there's another question of how you prioritize so from the greenhouse gas emissions um if you have to choose industry building Transportation you know power grids and Etc do you have a specific priority how do you put a priority where to start basically I think yeah I can I can jump on that I think first of all it's important what you are interested in and where you think you have most leverage so if it's a sector that I think is close to your methods your interest your knowledge um of course you have more leverage in this um then between different sectors we have currently different stages of decarbonization so reducing the greenhouse gas emissions the electricity sector is quite advanced in many countries so the technology is actually quite ready um and other sectors are are more difficult to decarbonize transportation for example is lagging behind or industry so you have different kinds of challenges with different sectors um that being said everything is important um it really matters to do something and to do it close to your interest and to work on a project that you think is impactful that's great yes and in um it's very exciting um I have another couple more questions so um I have a very interesting question it's like what is the plan for communities especially with vulnerable women and people living in disabilities concerning AI so what is what is the plan with that if any yeah it's a great question so I mean in general I think there have to be more initiatives that aim to democratize infrastructure and capacity building among a wider range of people so um the climate change AI summer school is is an initiative trying to do this but but there are some others as well where the goal is that um in general people from different populations should have the ability to understand AI to implement AI to shape the way it's developed and only by democratizing capacity in this way can we really create AI enabled climate solutions that are really representative of the the challenges and priorities across Society so I would say that the first order priority is always capacity building and knowledge building across a wide range of people okay and last one um before we enter a small very very flash break is can you talk more about rebound effects sure so in various settings um you are making a process more efficient or um lower energy lower emissions that can result in lower costs and that can mean that people use it more this is not the case in every situation sometimes lowering the emissions doesn't lower the cost um to the consumer um inside and sometimes lowering the cost doesn't increase the demand for it some some things just yeah yeah everything gets better and you know you don't you don't use the thing more um but in certain cases you can end up partially or even fully negating the benefits that you get from making something more efficient if the demand increases this is not a reason to not to work on making things more efficient but it is a reason to think very carefully about the area that you're working in and understand when rebound effects apply and to what extent they apply because sometimes they apply little sometimes they apply tremendously um and so it's very problem dependent this isn't something where you should say oh well that means I shouldn't work on any of these problems okay well thank you so so much this was an excellent lecture and I hope everybody is as pumping and excited for all the information you have provided and thank you so much thanks thank you I believe we will be taking a very very small break and then we will jump into the next lecture hello hi come out we are taking a brief boss so let's start one second we are so welcome everyone welcome back um it is my pleasure to make the introduction to climate change by Dr Kamal Cavalia um briefly uh she is the uh co-founder and chief of Eddie chief of Education from teradu Tara dot do um she has had a stellar career from going to really well-renowned institutions from Oxford to Berkeley and she will be giving us an overview of introduction to climate change hello I'll I'll set up that brief introduction for you to share screen thank you so much Olivia I'm really excited to be here um thank you for having me uh please give me a second uh um let me see if I can share this screen um sorry just give me a second here not finding the thing for some reason all right got it sorry about that tiny delay is everybody able to see my slides can you just give me a thumbs up excellent okay thanks again Olivia I am Kamal kapadia I am very excited to be here um doing this talk for the summer school I have titled my talk meaningful climate action and in this session I'm hoping to accomplish three things first I'm going to give you an overview of the scope of the challenge of climate change second I will provide some Frameworks for thinking about the solutions and third I want to provide some pointers on how you personally can engage in meaningful climate action so let's Jump Right In so there's a structure I like to use when thinking about this idea of meaningful climate action and it revolves around two concepts one is truth and the other is courageous action so we're going to dive into both sides of this today in this talk but first I'd like to start with a quick check-in and I request Amanda and Olivia to share a little poll and this poll just asks a very simple question on a scale of one to five how do you feel do you feel very relaxed like the kitten or very anxious like the hamster one being very relaxed by being very anxious and there is a purpose to this check-in and I will talk about it later in this talk so just work with me right now just do a little check-in and sometimes it's useful when you're trying to figure out how you feel to Just Close Your Eyes take a deep breath and just check in with your body because we hold stress in we often hold stress in our body so checking in your belly is your stomach tight in your chest is your chest feeling constricted shoulders and neck we often hold stress in our shoulders and necks take another deep breath your forehead is your forehead all the tight so just check in and tell us how you feel and I'm going to stop sharing my screen and I'm going to give you a moment to do this poll and then I'll request Olivia and Amanda to just share their screens and share the results see please everyone is in the comments so make sure that like you're clicking out there and again there is a purpose to this it'll I'll talk more about this later in this session but I'm just curious to see how folks are doing you might be having a technical issue at this point all right I guess what I suggest just write down this number okay write down this number for yourself write it down because we are you're going to need to refer to it later um so I'm going to go back to sharing my screen and we're just going to continue all right so coming back to this structure we're going to start with what's on the left hand side which is the truth part of this because there are some hard truths we have to face as we're doing this work so the first thing and this is pretty obvious to all of you who are here hopefully climate change is real and we are the cause um just a little reminder even though I'm sure you all know this very well by now um this graph is shows us carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere over 800 000 years this graph was produced by NOAA the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration which is a federal research agency in the United States they do a lot of climate science research and on the x-axis is a measure of it's just time so it goes back 800 000 years and now thanks to ice core data from Antarctica we can track carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere over this very long period And as you can see it has been varying over time but this is where we are now actually this is 2021 so you can see we are in some pretty Uncharted Territory and actually now it's even higher I think around 421 or 22 parts per million uh in 2023. so we are in some pretty Uncharted Territory with carbon dioxide concentrations for at least the last 800 000 years and the reason of course that we care about carbon dioxide is because it is our chief greenhouse gas of concern greenhouse gases are gases that trap heat close to the Earth and because it rapidly close to the Earth they are driving a global temperature change um and so this is another graph and you might be familiar with these Stripes these uh this uh this kind these colors are now used all the time they use on climate Twitter you might even have seen it on mugs Etc they were first created as a visual to show and demonstrate the impact of climate change on the Earth by Ed Hawkins who's a climate scientist at the University of reading um now this craft doesn't go quite as far back in time it's just to about the start of the Industrial Revolution in 1850 um and what this graph shows is a global temperature change relative to an average for 1971 to 2000 and you can just see from the colors how this has been changing over time and especially what's been happening since the late like say 1980s or so and so not only is global average temperature going up but the pace of this change is also accelerating and of course we know that we are the drivers of this this is a graph that just shows Global carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and land use change um fossil fuels are basically oil gas and coal and we burn them chiefly for energy land use change is just a change in an example of land use change is deforestation in order to expand land for agriculture and the total emissions keep going up um this tiny little dip is covered uh but it's continuing to go up um so again um greenhouse gases and the atmosphere aren't increasing because we are burning fossil fuels and engaging in other activities that are increasing the concentrations and of course carbon dioxide is not the only greenhouse gas of concern but it is at the chief greenhouse gas of concern but there are other important ones as well the second important thing to know a truth to face is climate change is here and now now when I first got into this space um we like in the late 1990s we used to still speak of climate change as something that was going to happen in the future uh even though we were already I mean if especially if you look at the observations Global Climate observations we were already experiencing climate change even then but it was still something that we spoke of in the future this is definitely no longer the case we are feeling these impacts everywhere all around the world all the time now every time I do a version of this talk I have to find different images of different natural disasters from around the world because they are coming so fast um we keep experiencing disasters everywhere this is an image from just last week uh Cyclone beeperjoy that hit Pakistan and parts of Western India and many of you may have seen in this image this is New York City from a few weeks ago and the skies are orange with smoke from the wildfires in Eastern Canada so the smoke had blown all the way over a big big swaths of Eastern us as well and of course you may be asking well do these wildfires happen anyway is this just you know unusual because the winds happen to blow in this direction and I think this graph captures it pretty well um this graph shows us cumulative hectares burned in wildfires uh uh in Canada and you can see where we are in 2023 so not only have these files taken off much early in what we are now calling a fire season but the cumulative hectors burned is already higher than any other year so far another question you may have is like how do we know if climate change is playing a role in these disasters and we don't have time in this talk to really get into this but there is a science called Extreme weather attribution and I think this is certainly an area in which data science ml plays a really big role as well and so if you are interested in this space so what this work of research does is they are able to quantify how climate change is influencing the intensity and the likelihood of these extreme weather events um so uh if you're interested in this I strongly recommend checking out this resource it's the world weather attribution website uh and every time there is a new extreme weather event they are able to quickly go in and do one of these attribution studies and look at the extent to which climate change has influenced any given particular event I want to draw your attention to this graph um you may have seen it if you're on climate Twitter or have been reading the news this was featured in the media recently so this is a graph of sea surface temperatures Global sea surface temperatures and um you can see on the x-axis it's just months of this of the year on the y-axis is actual temperature in degrees Celsius and every one of these wavy lines represents one year of measurements so this orange line is actually last year and this black line is this year and this graph is updated all the time so you can see this is very very recent from basically uh just a few days ago um and this is where we are right now with sea surface temperatures now mind you I want to call out that we are currently in what is also known as an El Nino event this is a particular kind of uh whether um it's actually a natural process event that occurs in the Pacific Ocean it has to do with the currents it creates it adds it creates warming Cycles um separate from climate change but we have experienced El Nino events in the past as well and we are still in extremely Uncharted Territory with Seas of global sea surface temperatures so many scientists are expecting a pretty brutal summer and of course all of this has real human impacts right it affects everybody uh and there are many many ways to talk about these human impacts uh in the interest of time I'm only going to draw your attention to one way in which we can be thinking and understanding what's going on with climate change impact on humans uh there is this amazing series of stories that were co-produced by propublica in the New York Times and they're called the Great climate migration and um it talks about how climate change is fueling migration around the world so we're not just talking about global migration which is uh mainly a global South to Global North migration but also domestic migration in the United States and in this story they they cite research that says right now only one percent of the earth is an unlivable Hot Zone and by 2070 even with just um sort of uh you know middle emission scenarios we could see 19 of the land being an unlivable Hot Zone so this is just one of the massive human you know systems we are disrupting and sending people fleeing from their homes for safety um now so climate change is real we are the cause it's here and now and all the scientists are telling us that exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius of average temperature increase uh compared to pre-industrial is dangerous uh now I want to call out a couple of things here one is that we are already somewhere between 1.1 to 1.3 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial so that's where we are right now average global warming uh and it's important to not see this 1.5 c as some strict line it's more of a point on a Continuum uh when we are really Crossing more into these multiple danger zones this is a graphic that's taken from ipcc and I'll talk a little bit about the ipcc in a few slides as well but what this graph just really shows is that as we increase temperatures risks of various bad things happening just go up right um and we we get into some pretty dangerous zones as we are crossing 1.5 c um so for example extreme weather events those risks go up or if you look down here uh if impacts on Warm Water corals those risks significantly increase as well um unfortunately we are almost guaranteed to cross 1.5 C now um although some people have different perspectives on this so I don't want to say it's definitely a given there are still scenarios in which we could stay under 1.5 C of global warming or at least um jump above a little bit and come right back down again if we can really all rally together and get our act together and I just want to spend a little more time a little time on this graph and I promise you this is going to be the last graph for a while um but I think this is an important graph uh and I want to spend a little time just breaking it down so this graph was produced by climate action tracker and what climate action tracker does is they look at all of the policies actions pledges targets that countries around the world are committing to and putting in place and they translate that into emission scenarios and expected temperature ranges that we would reach by 2100 so let's spend a few minutes on this graph so on the x-axis is just yours on the y-axis is global greenhouse gas emission so this is just a metric that combines all different venous gases into one metric um per year so this black line is a measure of our historic emission so you just see what we're damaging every year this tiny little dip is covered and of course we're right back up again um now I want to focus on three things on the right hand side of this graph so first this big blue wedge so what what climate action tracker done is has done is that they have taken all the policies and actions of all the countries and they've added it up and they have said if you if if you take all these policies and actions this is the expected future emissions that we will be kind of in this range it's a range and these are the expected temperatures 2.6 to 2.9 C that we would be at if you add up all the current policies and actions by 2100. so clearly this is way above where we need to be but this is kind of where we are now another thing I want to draw your attention to is this light blue line that says pledges and targets now the reason now pledges and targets actually has us getting to closer to two degrees C um and the reason pledges and targets is different from policies and actions is because every single country in the world now officially governments or most countries let's say the vast majority of countries have some kind of climate action targets so they say oh we they have some kind of carbon utility goal or Net Zero goal or they they're they're making efforts or they are at least making some pledges and setting some targets for themselves sometimes it's just some kind of um efficiency goals but they have various goals but the problem is these goals are not really translating into policies that are as ambitious as the goals need so this is why there is a discrepancy between pledges and targets versus policies and actions so even in the United States where we just passed this Landmark Federal legislation the IRA the inflation reduction act which is basically a massive piece of climate legislation if you just take the IRA it is not enough to get the US to be within its 1.5 c um emissions contributions so Ira alone won't get us to 1.5 C for the United States so this is why there is this discrepancy and of course the pathway we need to be on is this green line if we really want to be 1.5 C compatible by 2100 so we need to be rapidly reducing our emissions the rule of thumb is we should be having our emissions um uh in the next basically in the next seven years um and then we need to go to something like zero or what they call Net Zero um by uh 2100 so we need to basically stop all emissions and then be removing carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere um so if you're again this is just a very quick overview of some of the science if you are interested in digging deeper into this I recommend checking out the ipcc reports the itcc is the intergovernmental panel on climate change it is a UN agency that produces what is generally considered the authoritative climate science uh you know they they they summarize and share out kind of the the state of knowledge on climate change they are not they do not employ their own climate scientists they just convene hundreds of scientists from around the world to do this work recently over the last couple of years they've produced this thing called the six assessment report uh which is just an update on everything we know about climate change so again I recommend checking out the ipcc um so time for another check-in do you want to see the first one oh yeah I'd love to see the first one I'm gonna stop sharing yes so let me share that one because it's pretty interesting the distribution so this is the first one oh I see yeah oh yeah lots of trees yeah I see pretty fairly evenly distributed all right shall we try the second one and see where people are now I think so I think so yeah and what I'll do is I'll continue with the talk and then when you have the poll you can just let me know and we can perfect great so yeah folks share again in the poll how you are feeling I'm just curious all right it's good for you to check in as well meanwhile let's move on because there is another part to the truth and that is the world of solutions so let's spend a little time talking about Solutions now the way we think about Solutions broadly in climate is along these three axes the first is a mitigation mitigation is actually just reducing our emissions so stopping emitting greenhouse gases the second is removal removal is sucking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere um this picture shows a forest because trees you know naturally remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere but there's also several ways we can technologically remove carbon dioxide not just from the atmosphere but also from smokestacks so there's a whole bunch of technological solutions for removal and the last is adaptation because like we know we're already living through climate change and we need to adapt this picture is from a as you can imagine a poor Community the houses are built on stilts this is already a very simple adaptation technique for dealing with flooding but there are many many ways in which people are already adapting to climate change and there's a lot of work that we need to do here now there are these three axes but because this is a short talk I'm really going to focus only on the first one um and the key reason I'm only going to talk about mitigation is because there is no substitute for mitigation if there is one lesson that you take away from this talk it is this one which is there is no substitute for reducing our emissions rapidly and getting to what we call zero or Net Zero and I'll talk about that in a minute um removal is not a substitute for mitigation adaptation is not a substitute for mitigation if we are not reducing our emissions removal is not going to save us adaptation is not going to save us this is a very important lesson um and the reason for this is actually because carbon dioxide is a long lived gas once you put it up um about 55 of it is removed uh but by by natural processes but the rest of it just stays up in the atmosphere for a very long time and so as long as we are emitting a single molecule of CO2 we are adding to warming okay so even if we reduce the rate at which we are emitting year after year so long as we are adding any carbon dioxide to the atmosphere we are warming the planet and warming will only stop when we get to zero or net zero emissions globally so we we will continue to warm the planet until we are at zero or Net Zero and when we say Net Zero what this effectively means is we still have to eliminate we have to stop almost all emissions and then about 10 to this very hard to Abate sector we can remove the rest but it is very important to understand that if we slow down our rate of emissions we might slow down the rate of at which we are increasing warming but we will continue to warm the planet there is no substitute for going to zero or net zero emissions globally if we really want to solve climate change um now when we think about Solutions what's useful is to really think look at where are these emissions coming from uh this is a graph from our world in data this is actually a great resource our wooden data you might all be familiar with it already uh that it just has a lot of great um information and you can download all the data it's it's free access as well so it's a good resource so you can see that the vast bulk of our emissions come from energy uh this is energy that's used in our buildings in transport in Industry um and then agriculture forestry and land use change that's also a very significant source of emissions um and then of course there's a couple of other categories here industry and waste um this is what we these are these all kind of add up and uh these are all the main sources of emissions and so when you think about where we really want to intervene this tells you where we need to be putting in effort all these different sectors um essentially uh though one thing that is okay when it comes to certainly the technological solutions uh and even to a large extent now policies Etc we know what we need to be doing now this was not necessarily true say 20 years ago uh like or even like say in the late 1990s there wasn't really consensus for example on what might be the future for uh passenger transport so some folks thought it might be hydrogen and other folks were focused on biofuels and others were focused on electric vehicles and now we see that there is basically a consensus around electric vehicles and so we have a lot more clarity and for many many of these solutions they are very economically viable already we're not going to have time to just dig into all of these solution areas but there's a great resource by project drawdown that really lays out all of these solutions by sector extremely well and you can zoom in to any one of these and then you can click on it and you can just look at all of the different solution areas that exist within this one sector and you can click on any one of these and you can get information on the economics and on the climate impact um on how it works what are challenges Etc these are this is a great resource and I recommend spending a little bit of time on Project drawdown um the so we have all the solutions the main thing we need to do is really ramp it up like we need to dramatically increase the pace of deployment and we need to stop burning fossil fuels um that said I do want to point out that Solutions are not just about sectors okay there are different mental models for thinking about Solutions and while sectors are the dominant way in which we talk about it in the world of climate action um it's very very important to call out that there are these cross-cutting levers um that are also incredibly important so things like politics and activism obviously policies law regulation Finance corporate sustainability Communications education these are cross-cutting levers and they are very important powerful tools at Art disposal of course they also operate within the sectors but they can cut across sectors um one issue that I want to call out on its own because it is so incredibly important is climate Justice and if I had a whole other hour I would just spend the whole hour talking about climate Justice I think it is exceptionally important in fact I I 100 believe that if we do not Center Justice we are going to really struggle to fix climate change in that I think we will be undermining our capacity to fix this problem if Justice is not at the center of this conversation um and I think this is not only true for the developing world but it's also true globally as well Global North Etc uh one other mental model that I find useful and when I use this word mental model mental model is just the way in which our brain makes sense of something that's very complex and figures out how all the different parties relate um this idea of multi-solving is a useful mental model uh it's been developed by Elizabeth Savin who runs something called The multi-solving Institute and the idea behind multi-solving is that when we think about engaging in effective climate action it's useful to focus on those interventions that provide multiple benefits at the same time now I think this is especially important and true in developing countries I grew up in India in India you can't be talking about climate action without also talking about development there is a huge pressing need to solve poverty inequality this access to simple basic needs electricity water um the economy um you know needs to grow as well and so um when you know if you want to have effective action it is very useful to focus on those interventions that can also yield development benefits that can create quelting jobs that can clean up the air that can provide people access to basic services so um we spent a bunch of time on the truth part of the story We focused on the problems and we also focused on the solutions and now I'm going to get into this area of what I'm calling courageous action and I'm borrowing this concept a little bit from the all we can save movement um it is both a movement and a book it's also a resource and a kind of a a set of principles and guidelines on how we can build new models of leadership in this time of climate change uh they've separated courage and action and I've just combined it into one idea because I find that more useful so this idea of courageous action and this is where we're going to get a little bit more tactical and I'm hoping to provide some guidelines um just some pointers on how you can engage in meaningful climate action so um when folks uh like when folks ask me um okay what can I personally do to solve climate change uh if you look at the kind of the general world of answers that are out there to this Pro to this question they usually fall into two buckets okay either the general answers are either they encourage people to uh focus on their consumer habits so they say well one way in which you personally can make a difference is by uh being a conscious consumer so being you know conscious about your purchasing choices and if you have more money doing things like putting solar on your roof or buying an electric car um the other way in which you can engage personally the the usual response is you can engage as a citizen so if you live in a country where government is responsive to Citizen pressure you can engage in advocacy you can engage in activism you can help get the right kinds of leaders elected you can um you know of what you can engage in protest you can engage as a citizen um you can try to influence policy at all levels of government where you can engage as a citizen but I would argue that there is a third very powerful resource that you have and that is your career your job um so whether you're a student right now and you're going to be moving into the work workplace or whether you're already in some kind of job think about how much time of your life you are going to be spending in your career how much of your creative attention is going to be in your career in your job how much of your mental capacity um how much of your community is going to be in your job so this is an extremely powerful and important way in which you can have an influence on this problem it is through doing the work doing the work in your career itself so just I want to spend a couple of minutes focusing on this idea um so climate change is basically remaking the global economy this chart was actually pulled together by my co-founder and our CEO anshuman papna so sorry I don't have a source for all of these numbers but um it just shows uh the what percent of global GDP are these big sectors and all of these sectors are experiencing massive disruption uh because of what's going on due to climate change so Renewables is massively disrupting the whole energy sector many other things are as well um and so all of these sectors are undergoing massive transitions right now and what this means is that there are a lot of new jobs lots of new types of jobs being created even as all types of jobs are disappearing and um you know this is not just something that I'm kind of saying off the top of my head LinkedIn does this they've been producing this study every year recently for the last few years it's called the global green skills report Global green skills report and they are finding that the entire economy green economy faces large Talent bottlenecks so the growth in demand for green skills is outpacing the increase in Supply so you know if you look at this I've just taken this as a screenshot from their report um you know from 2022 to 2023 the share of Green talent in the workforce only increase about 12 but the uh it's like almost double of that number of job postings that require these skills so this is a very important space in which we need some work and honestly this is why we created um my myself and my co-founders why we created terra.2 uh the world's largest platform for upskilling talent into the green economy our goal is to get a hundred million people working directly on solving climate change by 2030. and I know that uh ccai also once you know they have a they have a similar Mission they want folks in data science to be working on this problem as well um and so we um have you know we've been around for three and a half years now and we have developed over this time what we call our learning for Action model and I want to share this with you because I feel this is useful not only as a general framework for us as a company but I think it is important for you to understand what the components of this are as you move forward and pay attention to all three of these because I think I'm I'm very sure that all three of these are equally important as you engage in this work so one obviously is knowledge acquisition and skills development and that's why you're in this course you're in this course because you're trying to learn things um but as you learn things and as you engage more in this work you are going to become more anxious okay this is hard work we are facing something that is very existential and so you need to build emotional resilience this is a muscle this is a capacity that we all need to build and at Terra we actually focus on this a lot uh we think it is extremely important it is as important as knowledge acquisition and skills development and goes hand in hand because you need this muscle in order to sustain you while you're doing this work in order to not burn out um and this is why we did those little check-ins those little check-ins were just a little taster of deeper work that we need to do because the starting point for building emotional resilience is just awareness like awareness of where you are in the moment so that's why we did these check-ins just as a little taster of what that might look like and of course the last thing is you need communities of bad practice and that's again what you all are right here at cecc AI you are a community of practice because this is very hard to do Alone um and communities just provide so a community of practice will provide so much value to you help you find jobs help you find your co-founders just help you find friends we have a similar community at Terra um you can sign on it's free for you to join and you can participate in our events Etc but I would argue that even these three are not enough even these three are not enough now I'm going to tell you what I mean by that and for that I need to pull this graph up again so remember when I said I'm not going to show any more graphs well I lied but you have seen this graph before um um and the one thing I didn't tell you the last time I presented this graph was that about 10 to 15 maybe about 15 years ago now the trajectory that we thought that all the climate scientists and experts thought that we were headed on looked like this okay I would say about 15 years ago we all thought that we are headed to really catastrophic levels of warming so more like four to five degrees C okay this is where the project all the projections if you look at the old ipcc reports um they they had us on this kind of a trajectory of emissions and the reality is that we have already been to this curve okay we have been to this curve obviously not far enough but all of this effort has had some effect all the effort that we've undertaken already and I would say that actually what's Driven the bending of this curve is courage okay it's taken courage it's taken people in government people in corporations people in universities people in communities doing something that's hard stepping out of their comfort zone and pushing pushing their organizations pushing from inside pushing from outside taking courageous action and that is what has been to this curve so of course what we need is a whole lot more courageous action because we still have work to do here so um I want to take a last couple of minutes just to talk a little bit about uh you know so if if you like what you if if you're if you like what you've heard in this talk and you want to dig deeper you want to learn more about the science you want to learn more about the solutions at Terra we have a boot camp this learning for Action boot camp it is a global online climate boot camp for professionals where we do get students as well or we welcome students to join us as well um we do all this is really focused on helping people find that sweet spot of intersection between your skills um the opportunities that are out there and maximum climate impact so helping you identify that and just launching You Into Climate work um and so again if you're interested just check out our website terra.do or you can join our community we run open houses about this course um every six weeks or so so one more check-in and I'm gonna stop sharing and I'm going to see actually if we have results from the last poll um also check on time yes we have plenty of time let me show you um I think we close up this poll very quickly but you can yeah and it was just oh my goodness that's a very interesting so can we do one more now of course one last one well I'll just wrap up the talk and we could switch to q a of course let me share my screen so yeah one last time Ollie's gonna share a poll how are you feeling close your eyes and check in for a moment all right okay and now I'm going to end and I am going to leave you with a prompt I am going to leave you with a prompt okay the year is 2045 and we have solved this problem we have solved climate change and you you are one of the many Heroes of this great transition and your story was inspiring to million now by this point Tara dardue is this huge massive platform and we have invited you to share your story we've invited you to share your story so think about what is one courageous act that will be part of your story what is one courageous act that will be part of your story go beyond your comfort zone face one difficult truth about yourself your organization your sector uh there shouldn't be something you've done before but something you will do use your imagination and think of courageous people you admire and their story um so that's all I have I wanted to allow enough time for Q a so I'm going to stop sharing I'll see if we have poll results do we have pulled results Amanda not yet all right you can start our role of a round of questions yeah sure so the figure talks about CO2 emission that increases significantly how about the portion of CO2 in the air so this is a specific question and whether it increases similarly so the distinction I guess is oh well okay so for this you need to understand the global carbon cycle okay so the global carbon cycle um not all of our emissions stay permanent like stay in the atmosphere and so uh about 55 is removed by natural processes so this is the ocean absorbs a huge chunk of um our emissions um and in fact we are putting so much extra CO2 into the ocean that we have changed the pH of the ocean okay we're making it more acidic and this is one of the big threats to coral reefs as well because leaves do not do well in acidic environments outside of just they don't do well with increased temperatures either um the so oceans absorb like a huge chunk of it and then uh you know plants absorb carbon dioxide too and so we we can see a little bit of a fertilization effect because of CO2 like especially in the northern atmosphere we're getting a little bit more plant growth although this is questionable because carbon dioxide climate change is also driving drought and wildfires so it's kind of complicated to say that overall there's a net fertilization effect but trees absorb carbon dioxide plants absorb carbon dioxide so so there are like about 55 of what we put out is removed from the atmosphere by these natural processes and they've been adjusting as we've been increasing so the ocean takes in more and more dynamically as we put more and more in um although even this is like a dynamic process and there's going to be some limit to it uh so the remaining 45 that's up in the atmosphere um it has it can have an extremely long lifetime like it can last thousands of years uh in the atmosphere so it's very slowly it's kind of slowly removed very slowly removed from the atmosphere Rock weathering also removes a little bit of CO2 which is a very slow geological process and so um that remaining percent stays in the atmosphere for a very long time um and it kind of like very very slowly decreases over time and so um so that is the stuff that's directly contributing to warming um the stuff that's left in the atmosphere uh adds what we call like radiative forcing essentially and so um but there's a pretty like direct relationship between emissions and like concentrations therefore like if you just account for this you know you can it's a very simple calculation honestly you can do this calculation yourself there's a simple way to just go from emissions to concentrations um and uh you know every year our concentrations continue to go up so even though up the pace at which we are emitting is slowing down like you saw even that graph like it's kind of like slowing down um we are still warming the planet because like I said this CO2 live for a long time in the atmosphere and this the path that remains and this adds to warming every molecule of CO2 adds to warming um it has a follow-up question of where and who will be most impacted as a result of climate change and how we can support them which is a great question it's a really important and good question um and I'll I'll answer this in a slightly convoluted way so you know the uh I mean obviously people with fewer resources so like folks in vulnerable communities around the world and these are generally folks who live more in poverty may not have like a lot of income um you know have experience like racial uh economic Injustice they are uh you know poor Farmers around the world like when I show that picture of the great climate migration like what you know when folks can't grow their own food they're not just going to lie down and die they're going to pick up and move but they are in distress I mean they are going to have to find a way to adapt so um that's definitely one group um but I will say that one should also not underestimate like capacity of for resilience and a lot of this capacity so like quite early in my career I was working for this company called Selco and what we did at Selco was rural electrification with solar PV in communities that lacked access to Grid electricity so we work in India Sri Lanka and Vietnam and I spent a lot of time in Sri Lanka like a few years in Sri Lanka we were and at that time there was a civil war in Sri Lanka and we were still trying to build this solar business like essentially doing Rural electrification and and the one thing I learned is like um you know even in the context of Civil War like there's an incredible amount of community resilience like and it actually comes from community and in fact I would say that in some ways like these highly like over built systems we live in in the US are almost more vulnerable because um like uh when folks like honestly like they were living in a a small Hut that's not that hard to like rebuild like when I think about the kind of infrastructure we have say in California and I've learned recently that um and it was in the news that uh not only one but two big insurance companies in the US have stopped providing home insurance in California okay so now all State and State Farm will not sell you home insurance in California and um this is partly because we um actually stay uh State Farm especially pulled out directly because of wildfires and the risk that wildfires are posing and the fact that when these disasters hit the hit on such a large scale it really affects the insurance company like they have to do like hundreds thousands of payouts and they can't they don't have the capital and so they are not providing home insurance and I'm thinking well if you can't buy home insurance in the United States like like what's going to happen to like this entire the entire economy like the entire the huge part of the economy is based on this like home sales and you know um you know and then there's a similar conversation going around around insurance in Florida like because of sea level rise and flooding and that risk and hurricanes as well like you know so once insurance is no longer available like what does that mean for entire millions and millions of people in this country um now so there's a little bit of a roundabout answer so I just want to make the point that we may think oh because we're better off whatever we're gonna deal better but I don't think that's necessarily true first of all secondly I think and I've seen this um is that uh when something bad happens uh having um a very strong Community because all weather events like all disasters are experienced locally okay they are experienced locally and the first um responders are always local and so you just having a very responsive system having a very strong local community where neighbors are looking out for each other where where folks are like connected um this is also extremely important component for like being able to recover and come out of disasters but obviously we want to be proactive right we don't want to have people undergo these disasters themselves and so that's this entire world of adaptation and adaptation is very very locally context specific so what kind of adaptation measures you might undertake in Mumbai might look very different from say New York City um even for the same kind of risk because it's very context specific it's resource it's resource constrained as well there's this huge emerging world of like Global Climate finance and there's a lot of I would say struggle and a deep amount of unhappiness from rightly I would say from developing countries on how little developed countries are like willing to contribute to this this big fund that they want to set up but the goal of this fund is going to be you know the goal of the fund is to finance a lot of adaptation um interventions in the developing world uh so it's very hard to answer this question like in terms of what can we do to help I I would say actually just start with where you are at and look around you and figure out like hey um you know what's going on directly around me like where I live in my community or even in my state like where are folks vulnerable um and you know can I get involved with some kind of organization that's working with them can I work with city government is there because often it's hard to access government but at least if you are in the United States or Europe city government is a place where you might have a little bit more access or influence or you might be able to support in some way cities are the place where um adaptation like it's kind of Ground Zero for adaptation again because these problems are experienced locally so uh you might want to think about can I work with city government can I work for a non-profit or a volunteer organization there are huge organizations like the Red Cross that depend on volunteers um can I become a volunteer firefighter if I live in a place where there's fires um so again look at your context look at what's going on around you understand what the climate impacts might be where you are understand where the vulnerable communities are where you might have some access and then you can make a call on this great great answer last question in the last two minutes and I show you the final poll just for your interest so regarding climate change attribution studies I'm aware that we can estimate the effect of anthropo um anthropogenic we're mean by comparing cmip historical simulations yeah cmap simulations with no anthropogenic emissions other other methods for attributing extreme weather events are similar to human activities but this is a great question so the only one that I know of is is this one and I'm not an expertise at all but there is a a sign this find the same Dr Frederick Otto Otto and she's written a whole book on this topic and she I would say she's kind of like defining the field she's one of the key people behind that uh website that I shared and um so I recommend I think her book is called like the angry weather or um so she's just it's a very new book so it should be pretty up to date um her last name again is Otto and I've been meaning to read this read this book myself um the my understanding of the again I am not a climate scientist so my understanding is exactly what you described which is these compare you know running the models with and without anthropogenic forcing and and so it's like a probability based kind of modeling which so I know and the other important thing I want to say is that it's actually it really depends on the different kinds of disasters and so certain things we are able to say with much more certainty and others it's still kind of a real evolving space so for example heat waves heat waves uh were able to like say things with more certainty in terms of like you know what are the chances to what extent that climate change make this event more likely but there's other things for example um Atlantic hurricanes um or even Cyclones apparently because like the history when you have events that are rare and you don't have a record that goes back very far um it becomes very hard to say for sure oh this particular event was you know with any certainty was made more likely by X percent so there's certain types of events where this is kind of still an evolving like really evolving field and it's harder to do these attribution studies now the reason these activation studies are so important Okay the reason I mean there's many reasons but there's I would say one key area that is very interesting that I've been watching is this space of climate lawsuits okay so in every country around the world now there are thousands of lawsuits around this world and there's actually an entire database that tries to track all of these even in the US there is a group of children okay there's this case brought by these children against I think right now the state of Montana um and so like basically saying you are not safeguarding our future and this is where these attribution studies become very important because you're trying to find a party to blame uh and so for example after Hurricane Katrina I believe there was a lawsuit trying to hold some um or you know oil and gas companies accountable the state of Hawaii is suing some oil and gas companies I think as well and so um you need to be able to say like you want the science to be able to attribute your particular experiences to climate change in order to be able to say okay now you know we know this is caused by climate change and we know that you are you're you have contributed X percent of climate change um so this is one area of application for these attribution studies that's very important and actually Amanda might know more than me because she works in this she's a lawyer but she's from lost about a law degree but um it's a worth also there's like lots of other reasons for doing these attribution studies for example like all of the climate risk assessment work that essentially every organization now certainly Financial organizations are trying to undertake um and there's a lot of data science stuff going on in this space as well like uh because uh large you know EU regulation and soon probably U.S regulation is requiring large financial institutions to quantify this risk and so they have to figure out there's two types of risk broadly right like physical climate risks like literally like how will climate change directly physically affect your assets and then this thing called transition risk so as the economy transitions into say clean energy if you are left with standard assets so you actually have financed all these cold plans and now suddenly there's no need for them that's called a transition risk and so um there's a lot of work around trying to quantify these risks and this attribution studies are important there as well so I'll stop there but I think this is a great question I'm sorry but I do recommend that book and I'm going to check it out myself okay I'll I'll post it later come out thank you so so so much for an excellent lecture I'll show you briefly the the poll that has gone again back a little bit more oh a little bit back no no it's great no it's great so we're gonna take a pause of two minutes thanks again thank you we will go back into um to the lectures all right well thank you so much for having me yeah thank you and thank you for the great work you're all doing all right bye-bye all right folks let's go for the last one so it's a pleasure to present the last lecture of today's uh today's day um is the introduction to machine learning by our own Rasika balarao and she's an assistant teaching professor at Northeastern University cooperi College of computer science in San Francisco Bay she holds a PhD from NYU tendon and she is currently serving as Vice chair of the communications committee here at climate change AI this is hard and please first take a ticket away I'm gonna stop sharing thank you so much uh let me share my screen all right and um of course please let me know if it if it's not sharing correctly um sounds good all right um well um thank you for that introduction uh my name is Rasika um I'll be talking about an introduction to machine learning um so here's our overview of our agenda first I'll just introduce machine learning um and then we'll talk about three main types of machine learning so that's supervised learning unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning and then we'll have some examples at the end so um you know first uh you know you might have heard of machine learning a lot I'm going to assume that there's a wide variety of backgrounds here um so uh you know if you want to kind of uh Define it with just one sentence um you know Andrew and uh very uh succinctly put it like this um the science of getting computers to act without explicitly being programmed um and so um yeah this is kind of different from just regular uh coding without machine learning where you have to explicitly tell it you know when you see this you do this when you you know that kind of thing um here the computer will learn Based on data that we give it um and so as I briefly mentioned before there are three main types of learning the first one and most common one is supervised learning and that is where the computer learns to predict or classify labels based on labeled data that we gave to it before um right so basically just copy the same pattern that you saw in the input data copy that in the future then the second type of learning is unsupervised learning and so this one is not labeled the data is not labeled and so the computer just finds patterns that it can use later on without being explicitly trained which patterns to copy and then the third one was reinforcement learning and this one um has been gaining popularity recently um but uh yeah so basically this is where the computer learns um well-performing behavior um from observing the you know observation and uh from the state and then also the rewards that the um that it receives from the from the um uh environment so uh and this one is the reinforcement learning is not uh limited by the labels or anything that we can give to it so that's why it's so powerful and been gaining popularity recently um is because it can do better than uh labels that we gave to it with supervised learning um so to tell the difference between the first two supervised versus unsupervised learning um here's here's an example I've got some fruits um two apples one's green one's red and then two bananas one's green and one's yellow um and so with supervised learning we would tell the computer this one's an apple that one is an apple this is a banana and that's a banana right we would tell it that and then in the future when the computer sees an apple it'll know that it's an apple right that supervised learning where we train it to know exactly what to do um with unsupervised learning this is um you know so the same data right two apples to bananas but uh we don't label it right we just um the computer learns that oh these two apples are similar and these two bananas are similar or maybe it learns that this picture is red the middle two are green and the last one is yellow right it learns kind of patterns about what these things have in common um and that's all right it learns about the patterns and the underlying underlying patterns in the data there are also some different data types that you might use um and you will definitely use when you're if you continue on with the summer school here um so these are very common data types well one is just continuous right continuous numbers um this is most numbers that you might think of um and then discrete is not continuous right so it could be numbers but it could also be just like categories um or anything that isn't continuous um oh go back um and then of course there's categorical which is uh you know actually labeled categories um for um like for example they might be names rather than numbers uh right so there's not really an order to the categories um then there are two other kind of special cases a categorical one is binary so that's where there's only two categories um and then there's ordinal where the categories are ordered so there's an example or two examples here um the how do you feel today right we had a similar poll to that earlier today um so yeah how do you feel today right like these are these are categories but there's a bit of an order to them um or you might have uh filled out a form like the one on the right before where you ask how satisfied are you with our service um and then you have to say something between one and five and um you know there's an order but the numbers aren't particularly you know it's the order that matters so um the data types that you might use um here let me just um open this um in climate change data um right a very popular type of data is tabular data where it's it's what it sounds like it's in a table right each item is a row and a table and the columns are the features um but then there's also other types of data that you might not think of at first when you think of what types of data you'll be using um so that would be like Time series right um where the time or just the order of the data is an important part of the data it's an important part of the input there's also graph or network data and so you've seen these before right for example the social media friends graph um or just you know within social media just the tweets and retweets right where um each item is like is a node in the graph and then there's edges between them and then you know other types of data images um often this is represented with each pixel is three continuous features right a number for the red a number for green and a number for Blue um so you can represent images as three numbers per pixel and then of course very popular recently language or text um where each word is a categorical feature right so basically any word from the dictionary or you know whichever set of possible words you're using each word will be um one category from that set of category you know set of words basically so these are really common types of data that you might use um when you're doing climate change stuff so that was a very brief introduction to machine learning um we will now go into supervised learning and and talk about some types and some issues that come up with it so overview of how supervised Learning Works you start with some training data like this right um so for example this is this is some example data set it's not real uh where you have four people um named cat elephant dog and turtle and each one has an age a location and whether or not they are a customer labeled um right so you you have some data like this and then you want to train a supervised learning you know a model based on this so um right so once we have that data we collected our data um we use that training data to build a model and that model might look like this right where the the model says if their age is less than nine then yes they are a customer and if their age is greater than or equal to nine then no they are not a customer right so you might learn a model that just takes all of the other features and then predicts the one that you said was the label right that's what a model might look like once you have built that model right here's our model just copied from the previous slide then you can use it in two different ways one is to evaluate that model right you want to actually see how good of a model it is on data that it has not seen before so you have your your test data set basically that looks very similar to your training set um but it's just you know items that were not in your training set so but but they are formatted the same and then you see how well your model performs on this test data uh right so penguin and snake these were two customers or you know people I guess that were not there in the training data and then we see how well the model predicts whether or not they are a customer right and so it looks like it works pretty well on this test data set right the when the age is less than nine then yes age is greater than nine though both of the items in the test data um fit that you know the the model performs accurately on these so so the model performs well on this test data set and then the other way that you might use your model um is on unseen real world data um and so this is where you get a new person and you don't know if they're going to be a customer or not right like maybe you're deciding whether to approach them to be a customer so you get their you know their age and then you look at your model and you say based on this model uh would this person probably be a customer uh and then you know your model will say yes or no um and then yeah you're using your model on Unseen World data unseen real world data to to use it in the real world okay so two common the two ways that you might use your model okay um so with supervised learning right the the model that we just learned was basically like is the age greater than or equal to a certain number and then yes or no right the yes and lower the two categories that um that you could have as your output so generally with supervised learning there are you know there's two types of supervised learning algorithms um one is with categorical labels right so the example that we just had was categorical right yes or no two categories um other examples would be a model that's predicting whether or not someone is pregnant right like a pregnancy test um or which country they are from right all the countries will be categories and then and then that um or like which type of road sign is it in this picture those are all categorical labels um and so you would you would do classifying for those um and then the other type is with continuous labels uh so for example predicting the future stock price right that is a continuous thing to predict uh or life expectancy or distance to an obstacle in a picture um right these are things where you want to predict a continuous number so you'll use different algorithms for that so this is kind of usually whatever I'm introducing a classifier this is what I use as the example um so let's say that you have a trading set like this right where um there are some rows in your data there are four rows in your craning set um and you know you've extracted two features for each thing X1 and X2 and uh so you can see those four rows and you can see them plotted on on this graph right and so you know two of them are red two of them are blue um and then now we have a new instance that's that outline of a circle at six six um that's our unseen instance intuitively by looking at this picture you would think it should be blue right because it's way closer to the blue dots than it is to the red dots so that's kind of you know it's taking the closest things to it in the training set and then um whichever one those things are whichever color those things that are close to it are it's it's taking that category so that's that's called the K nearest neighbors algorithm that that is the algorithm that we just talked about so basically for the test data you check the K instances in the training data that are closest to your new instance right so you pick a k um and then you say okay if K is 4 then you say okay out of the four closest things in the training set um like what are they then that's the category that you'll use here um if your output label is categorical then you'll choose the majority label as the label that you're using and then if if they're continuous then you can choose the mean or the median of those values um right depending on how what works best with your data you can choose how you want to kind of get the the average of those values whichever algorithm you want to use um so this is this is the simplest kind of K nearest neighbors algorithm um yeah so another algorithm that you might see um it's kind of the very popular one at least very popular uh linear regression and so basically this is to predict a continuous output right so um where you have X which is any real number and Y which is also any real number we want to find a linear function that takes us from X to Y right so the input is X and the output is y um and so right so we're just finding a line that tells us how to get from X to Y um and the way we Define this line is it's the line that has the smallest mean squared error between the prediction right so the what we said the line would be and the ground truth which is what the data actually is right so basically you find the line that is as close to the middle of all of the dots as possible so this picture on the right is is an example of that where we had some data those are the blue dots and then we calculated the red line by um being the line that is the smallest squared error between the dot and the line um and so right that's for if it's a line if it's not a line um there it might be a polynomial right or it could be some other function and luckily this is actually the same problem underneath right because uh instead of just having it be a linear function of X it's some other function of X and um the you know the the beta values here in this equation are things that you're solving for um and then the the you know so it looks very similar to a linear function um it's just that you raise your actual data to some exponents which luckily you already know your data so this will become a linear problem basically um right so it turns into the same process as a linear regression um as long as you already know the value of the exponent that you are raising your data to so it looks like this picture on the right um where instead of a line now it is this polynomial with degree three and um but otherwise the line goes through the dots just like it did before so and I noticed how I mentioned like as long as you know the value of d right then the value of the degree of the polynomial um you have to know which like what shape your data takes basically so that brings me to the next question which is what if you don't know the value of d right what if you don't know the degree of your polynomial in advance um so often we you know uh kind of check how good our model is by you know the squared error right like the same thing that we did to actually calculate the line um that's how we know how good the model is right like if the distance between the ground truth and the predicted value is very small then it's doing well um right so we calculate that sum of squared error um and we can see how well it does for different values of d right so based on like if we assume that the degree of the polynomial is uh one then r squared error is going to be like 650 something right that's what this graph says um and then if the degree of the polynomial is two then the error will be a little bit lower but still you know like 475 or something um and then if the degree of the polynomial is three then our error will be a little bit less than 100 so that is a lot better and then degrees four onwards um you know there they do decrease the error right they are a little bit better but not a lot but you know so yeah looks like the best uh kind of bang for your buck um is with degree three according to this graph here um so I would fit a polynomial of degree three on the data that we have um trained this on um of course as I just mentioned right uh we're choosing degree three even though degree 10 has a smaller sum squared error right um and so that's that's what this question is asking here what's the problem with choosing degree that has a lower squared error uh you know that would be because uh the degree with the lowest squared error is going to be the largest degree possible which is um you know the size of your data set that's going to have the smallest squared error because everything will be exactly perfectly predicted and your model will be a hundred percent accurate on your training set that will be the lowest squared error um and that degree is terrible because it'll be a very squiggly line and um and uh you know it's going to take a long time to calculate and everything so you know that's that's not the ideal so we don't want to choose the degree with the lowest squared error instead we want the one that performs reasonably well um but still is you know pretty small degree so what I just mentioned right where it's a very squiggly line and every single data point is perfectly predicted in your training set um that's that's called overfitting so um you know we've got three graphs here let's look at the graphs on the bottom first um where excuse me the orange dots are the data that we're trying to fit and the blue line um is the model that we are training right and we're trying to make the model fit the data um so on the left we've got under fitting because you know the the data does look a little bit curved but we just put a line there and so that's you know that's not really a high enough degree to fit the data well so that's underfitting um then on the in the middle we've got just right right it that curve looks like it follows the curve of the data um and then you know yes not all of the data is exactly on the line but generally it looks like that it fits the the data and then on the right we've got over fitting which is what I was talking about like a really squiggly line and uh right you're trying to fit as many of the little dots as possible but uh you know if you look at it it looks a little silly right like I don't really think that's how the data should you know that's not the right model right unless we have a really complex model underneath um it that's probably not the right model right most models are not supposed to be that complicated so that's overfitting yeah I have a very quick question if you're taking questions at this point in time yes please um yes so there is um a question of how is distance determined for categorical values to help determine what's near uh what it's near uh since you know distances are very well defined for continuous variables how do how would you do that yeah that's a really good question um so yes and so just to kind of summarize like um so far yes I've been talking about distance in terms of like continuous outputs um for categorical um there's a few uh like basically just like different measures that we use um when we are training the model we often use like the probability of it being that category right and so that's a number that you can kind of have it be um like close in probability and then also um you can also just test uh whether or not it got the category correct right so like one if it got it correct and zero if it didn't um and that's often for uh testing how good your model is after you've already trained it so yes that's a very good question um these uh kind of examples that I'm showing here are for continuous outputs yep um yeah I'm glad that question came through please continue asking more questions um yeah awesome okay so yes with continuous values here right that is overfitting that one on the right um this one is overfitting um it's way too squiggly and probably more complex of a model than the actual data warrants um then so you know how do you know if you're overfitting that's this graph on the top up here right so as you're training your model you will get this blue line that's called like the training accuracy right so as your model gets more and more complex your accuracy will get better and better right it'll you know the more complex the training accuracy will get better you'll go through more of your training data points um yes but your testing accuracy will increase at first until it's the right level um and then your testing accuracy will go down again as the model gets more complex than the you know then it should be and you know it doesn't generate relies well to test data so that's you know that's the yellow line is the testing accuracy and we want a model that will do well on the actual real world data right so the test set that's what we want right we want the top of the yellow line so the the idea is that we want to find like how the model does on unseen data and so a really popular solution to overfitting is cross-validation so basically your training data that you had that you were training your model on um split it into two sets and one of them is your actual training set and then the other kind of set aside part of the training set will be a validation set excuse me and so basically you trade it on your training set just like usual and then you test how well the model does on your validation set to decide whether or not your training set needs to train more and become more complex or not right and so this is still not your actual test set so right you don't want to look at your test set before um before actually testing that's cheating um but it is it is a validation set so it is you know you're not training the model on it you're just checking how well the model that you're currently training does on some tests right you're just checking how well it does without actually training on that data um and so you know that's called cross validation we use it often to avoid overfitting um right by just checking how well data how well the model does on data you haven't seen how well the model hasn't seen before really um cool so yep that's overfitting make sure not to do overfitting um right so yes um that was a good question before right all the stuff we've talked about um well the the pictures that we looked at were from uh sorry continuous labels um and so if we're doing categorical labels um then that's called classification and so a really popular classifier um uses logistic regression right and so for example here is some data here on the left right where we have um like the what we know the x value is like the average score basically and then the thing we're trying to predict the category is whether or not it got accepted right so like some you know zero or one yes it got accepted or no it didn't get accepted and uh right this this is going to not do well with a linear regression right like you can kind of look at it and see that a line will not go through this data well right because there's a bunch of dots all in the same place for each of these right and they're all stacked on top of each other and um you know they're it's not on the line so a line is just not going to fit this data well and even if we said okay make it the probability um of accepting right so since it's a bunch of data numbers stacked on top of each other we can check what percentage of them were accepted that is a probability um and so that becomes the graph on the right where it's the probability like the percentage that we're accepted um that's the plot um even if we do this uh still not great for a linear regression because well linear lines go from negative Infinity to positive infinity and um this is not going to Infinity so you know so we do need something like different for categorical outputs and so the you know popular solution here for logistic regression is to map the probability right so first the probabilities were from zero to one you map it into the range from negative Infinity to positive Infinity um so that it becomes something that you can fit with a line right so take the thing from range01 into negative Infinity positive Infinity um and then now you can do your regression like before so that's a really popular classifier right because even though yes it's using continuous values those values then can be translated back into probabilities um which you can use for your category output so that was a very popular classifier there are other supervised classifiers that are very popular um so I'm just going to list a few of them here um definitely not going to go into detail on all of them but there are resources that you can you know that are linked that you can use too so one is decision trees right and so that looks a lot like this right so here is a model that is a decision tree um determining whether a word is at the end of a sentence right so we have some text we got the word and we want to know if the word is ending a sentence or if you should continue reading the next word because that was not the end of the sentence right so we're trying to decide whether it is so the first thing we ask is um are there lots of blank lines after this word um if yes then it is the end of the sentence if not then it's not right then you check the punctuation afterwards um and you know two two questions about the punctuation and then last of the last of it is um whether or not it's an abbreviation right because if it's abbreviation then the period probably was not for ending a sentence but maybe it was or something else so right we just have a series of questions that we use to determine whether or not the word is the end of a sentence right and so learning this tree um is something that we can do with you know a machine learning algorithm and this tree is called a decision tree very useful uh you know I'd recommend looking into them they perform well um then there are also support Vector machines which look very similar to logistic regression um they are just more geometrically motivated so right where uh logistic regression would find a line that kind of um best separates the zeros from the ones basically um support Vector machines also does that but it finds a line that you know geometrically fits separates it better so out of these three lines red green and black linear regression might find either the green one or the black one but support Vector machines would find the red one because it most neatly separates the orange and the blue with like a lot of extra space on each side um and so that's that's kind of a support Vector machine um is that it separates things with the most bass and um you know it also has a really nice motivation that doesn't have to be a line separating it it can have other shapes as well um and so I recommend looking into it if you want to separate your categories with something other than a line um then of course there was naive Bayes which I don't have a picture for um but you know that's just another way to kind of um just use probabilities to determine the category of something um and then yeah then the last one is of course a neural network um very popular as you can see from this picture it involves a bit more computation so oh go back one side a lot more computation so you know uh more more compute more complexity right that that takes more more uh time and uh resources um but also it can perform very well as you've seen in the news right so here we have our input features X1 X2 X3 we have a bunch of computation here in the middle and on the right we have two output values y1 and Y2 and so right just another way to go from X to y EP I have another question from the public is are there a minimum number of data points required for linear regression to be reliable basically how large a data set is considered sufficiently large for linear regression to be successful oh that's a really good question um it's like power analysis you um yeah like excuse me that's a really good question um mostly because I don't have like one solid number for you um generally uh I would recommend looking at your data if it looks like a line then it might be um something worth worth trying um it's it's actually I would recommend doing it like if you have a lot of data then um well if it's if it's way too much data then maybe go back to linear regression because that's a little more computationally like saves more energy but um otherwise if you have a lot of data but it's not like a giant amount of data um other models could also do well um right that might perform a little bit better maybe you're like maybe it's not exactly linear right but you can actually tell that complexity with a more complex model um but uh yeah there there's you know I guess at least two would be the number if you want like a concrete number for for the size uh that's a really good question um and of course all the other people on this call please feel free to jump in with like examples you've seen um where there's a like this was too small of a data set for linear regression um yeah linear regression works really well honestly like I've tried it with a bunch of stuff um with like more complex models in other places and then it and then I tried linear regression it turns out that that did way better anyways than a complex model right so like I think it does well in a lot of places um that uh you know may not be determined only based on the size of the data um yeah uh but yeah please you know that that's a you know different experiences we'll say different things too um but one thing that I think a lot of us will agree on um is that you don't want to re-implement these algorithms yourself right like I've talked about like learning this tree and learning the you know the linear function um do do not re-implement it yourself so unless you're like doing research on the method itself or you're just trying to learn how it works um or you're coding in an obscure language where it isn't already implemented um the already implemented versions are widely used and tested and like they are being maintained um so definitely use the existing implementations um and then of course also um here are some links to common tools psychic learn has um it's open source and it has a lot of um unsupervised and supervised methods that you might need um and then if you want to build your own model then Pi torch and tensorflow um all good places and then there are also a lot of task specific libraries as well I'm sure that they will introduce those as they come up in in the rest of this this summer school um so I'm just going to quickly move on right we've been talking a lot about supervised learning and then yeah that life tip applies to everything um but uh so unsupervised learning right as I was mentioning is where you learn kind of patterns and unlabeled data right so for example learning clusters right in or groups in the data so the example is up here on the right um these are just like um news Google News basically this is a screenshot of Google news and they have automatically clustered news articles by category right so that's that's clustered they've clustered these these news articles by category um some other places right so finding clusters um other places that people use um clustering algorithms would be for customer segmentation right so you want to find what sort of groups of customers do you have um or maybe finding user accounts that are all suspiciously similar maybe they're all the same person um maybe uh grouping your search results like the picture up here on the right um so and then you know there's a lot of other kind of applications of clustering algorithms um but you know a common question is like what other types of unsupervised learning are there um there are some so uh for example topic modeling right so if you have a bunch of text and you want to know what is being talked about in that text um maybe you can you know it's like find the topics in a group of documents basically or a lot of times people use unsupervised learning to figure out what are the important features that they can then use for supervised learning um right so the input features that they use for supervised learning um that is something to decide and so you can use unsupervised learning to decide that um and similarly right you can learn Vector representations for words and documents um right so instead of just selecting important features this would be actually learning some like representation um that is not just a subset of the features but is a new feature for each word or document um and then of course language modeling right just like how um the popular language models um they just read in a bunch of text that was not labeled and now they can do a bunch of stuff with it so um yeah there's a lot of unsupervised learning out there but the most popular is clustering of course um and then yes text rank um which is like part of text summarization that's not labeled um but it still kind of ranks words based on how important they are for documents so clustering right um You don't have labels so the data looks very similar to the training set of a training um you know the training set um but there's no label so there's just the you know the item and then its extracted features and then you find natural groupings in the data so that same data on the left you know let's say you graph it you've got feature one feature two here on the right and then you plot it uh the clustering algorithm should hopefully detect that there's a group that looks similar here a group that looks similar here and a group that looks similar there right so this is not labeled data it's finding patterns um and of course right this is something that uh there's not one correct answer for uh so right that's why um the same data as you can see here um may have different clusters so uh you know you can see here on the bottom left it's two clusters or on the top right it's six different clusters right just based on how you define your clustering algorithm it'll find different uh clusters based on that because there's not just one correct answer when it comes to this there are two types of clustering algorithms uh one is just flat clustering algorithm so that means you start with a random clustering and then you make it slightly better slightly better slightly better until it's good right and then that's your that's your cluster rate um otherwise there's also hierarchical clustering which basically um it turns your data into a tree like this so the things that are closer together in the tree are closer together in real life and then the more joins you have to go through in order to get to the other item uh the further apart those two things are so that's hierarchical clustering and there will be some pictures in a few slides as well k-means is from the first category it's the flat clustering algorithm usually people use k-means as a baseline as I've seen right so just like some example of how like everyone knows k-means basically they assume and so if you want to know how well kamis does then that's how it does and then here's our wonderful other clustering algorithms right so they use it as a Baseline k-means clustering is basically exactly what it says right oh you start with um a random you know assign each item into a cluster and then you readjust the center of the cluster to be the mean of the point so it's basically randomly assign it first and then keep making it slightly better slightly better slightly better until the Clusters are reflect the data well so here's an example right we start out with this data like this um we randomly pick three cluster centers like this uh blue red and pink um and then we assign each data point to its closest Center and then we update the centers to be the the mean it uh the average of the things that are data points and then you update the data points and then you update the centers and then you update the data points and then you update the centers and then you update the data points and uh finally when they stop changing right that means that this is as good as the clustering is going to be and then those are your clusters from your k-means clustering algorithm a really major problem with k-means clustering is that it does not perform well with outliers right so here's a picture of it not performing well without layers let's say this was our data like this right we've got a bunch of dots down here and then three dots here and we said we have four clusters well each of these dots is going to take up a whole cluster and then oh go back uh each of these dots is going to take up a whole cluster and then uh you know then our actual data down here which is not outliers kind of just all gets assigned to one cluster um this is not ideal as you can see right we didn't actually detect the actual clusters down here so yeah outliers are going to just you know give you the wrong clusters when you use a k beads clustering algorithm so which brings us to kind of higher article clustering right the other type of clustering uh where it turns your clusters into a tree right so here's some data on the right and then there are circles drawn based on how close the data is to each other and then that same clustering is reflected in this tree on the left so like for example one and three are very close together so one and three are in the same little tree down here uh right and then the further apart that two data points are the more joins you have to go through to to you know to connect those two data points in the tree so that's hierarchical clustering I'm going to go a little bit faster just to kind of get through the lecture time yeah so yeah and then you know the in psychic learn there's a bunch of clustering algorithms that you can get through um uh so I recommend looking at them um the last type of learning that um that we're talking about today the third type is reinforcement learning and that's where um the agent learns from its environment right so not labeled data but rather learns from the rewards that it got from the environment so here's an agent that's learning and it's interacting by performing actions in the environment and the environment gives it back a reward and a new state that is the result of the action that it took um so for example um the game of Pac-man right you're training the the Pac-Man this is Pac-Man I think um and then the root you can Define it that the reward is one if the Pac-Man eats a pill um then the reward is negative 10 if you get caught by a ghost right so you define some rewards like this and then the um the algorithm will train it to uh you know eat the most pills and not get caught by ghosts um when you're doing reinforcement learning a kind of key concept is that you want to balance exploration versus exploitation um and so basically uh like exploitation is where you take good actions based on what you already know works right you exploit the knowledge that you already have um whereas exploration is you actually take a chance on actions that you may not actually know that they perform well yet but you take a chance on them because maybe you actually learned that they are good in the long run or something like that right so you explore the options and a key Concept in reinforcement learning is balancing the two so you start out by exploring a lot and then as you learn what performs well then you exploit that by using that path more often um here's an example very very quickly um right so here's the lizard game there's a lizard here that's the agent that you're trying to learn lizard wants to eat as many crickets as possible right so five would be ideal one is okay I guess um and then the bird is bad the bird will eat the lizard so you want to get the lizard to the Crickets um right and so uh you can Define your rewards based on like how many crickets it got and uh you know and how it avoid the bird um and so you can see how you'd want to balance exploration and exploitation right because if you've somehow learned that there's a cricket up here and you didn't learn about the five crickets down here then when you're exploiting your knowledge that you already know you'll just keep going up to the one cricket and you'll never explore and learn that there's five crickets over there and so that's why you gotta explore everything first and then after you know where the you know where is the best reward then you can start to exploit that knowledge a little more by a little right and so yeah um if we only did exploitation it might get stuck going only up to the one cricket so right very quickly those were the three types of learning supervised unsupervised and reinforcement learning um I'm just going to quickly talk about two um examples that have come in as papers to ccai's workshops recently so uh right you can the links to those papers that people have submitted to the workshops um are they're here this is the first of the two examples um and the example is predicting bicycle counts right so basically um you're given the data set is historical data of the number of bicycles in certain locations per hour oh thanks for publishing the poll um it's available in the circle um so yeah so you're given the historical data of how many bicycles there were in each location per hour and then going forward you want to predict how many bicycles there will be in future times at those locations right and this is actually someone's paper this is a real data set um and uh yeah so we have there's a poll out there for the best option right so we use linear regression should we do overfitting should we do clustering and should we do reinforcement learning so um let's see the poll was published about like a little under a minute ago so I will give you a few more seconds we seem to be having some issues with the permissions to okay permissions but yes meanwhile I can throw you a couple of questions that I have seen from the public so how to choose the best data analysis method and for example in the case of a binary on a binary Target um we uh there's a lot of choices and how what would you choose logistic regression super Vector machines decision trees and what would be um what will be best yeah that's a good question so so sorry just to clarify your first question like how to choose the right data like do you mean like binary data data analysis method so what I think basically is like which algorithm would work better oh okay um yeah uh of course I can see that um you know a lot of different people will have different answers for this um but uh yeah I always recommend first understand your data really well like um so there's like exploratory data analysis basically first um like understand oh uh the numbers are very lopsided here right we have a lot more positive than negative or something you know understand the distribution of your data um what sort of outliers you have where are all the errors in your data collection that you might want to avoid um right understand your data really well um and then based on that then you can choose um the the right algorithm so for example if you have uh like a lot of um a lot of categorical data just like a large huge amount of categorical data um then naive Bayes might actually work best just because it's a lot quicker um for large amounts of data like requires Less storage um right uh but uh yeah otherwise I could try a lot of things um I've seen like uh with decision trees people often use like a bunch of decision trees in what's called a forest like a random Forest um those perform really well as long as um as long as you'd avoid overfitting basically um but uh yeah so depending on your data but please others feel free to jump into uh when you chose the right data yeah I I also do via performance so what performs better which algorithm kind of fits better the task and the in terms of performance that I also would add um another question um which it labels itself as a dumb question which I think we don't there's no dumb questions yeah right no so but how do you determine how useful your unsupervised clustering was or how will it work and how do you decide between flat and hierarchical that's a great question in my opinion yeah that is a really good question um and that's actually something that like we definitely like we didn't get time but that was something that I thought might be good to include is evaluating your clusters um and so there are some like numerical ways you can evaluate your cluster like how close together are your clusters and then like within each cluster and then how far apart are they from other clusters right like that's a thing you can calculate um but uh yeah I guess um other than those kind of like just straight a number um it's also just with unsupervised learning like how how much information did it give you right like that's like did it give you the patterns you were looking for would probably be um the the thing to measure um and then in terms of like choosing flat versus hierarchical um there's a few like instances where only one will work for example like um for example if you only know the distance between items but you don't actually have like the items themselves then you're gonna need it to be a hierarchical clustering um right so for example if your rows are like text or something like that um if you actually plotted that on like a giant several hundred thousand dimensional data space like that would not be you know good so um instead you might just only measure kind of the distance between the text like how many words are different how many characters are different um and you only know the distance between them and so then that would be you would have to use use a hierarchical clustering algorithm because that is based on distance between things rather than the actual items themselves um but you know other than uh other than if they're if you have some data that'll work on either case then um yeah like whichever one gives you the information you're looking for um and which one performs best right like if if you find out that there's a lot of outliers then maybe the the hierarchical will work a lot better anyways just to sorry you're muted Olivia yes one more question and perhaps there's an issue with the permissions of the polls okay so um one more question and then maybe you can arrange those and then when we can post it oh no there is it's out there oh it's great oh fantastic it's fixed so so guys the polls are open okay um but I'm just gonna include let's go first with the pulse and then I ask you more questions okay okay sounds good yeah great um so oh so they just opened then I'll give them like 10 seconds to uh to click the answer here so again for the public predicting bicycle counts so given that historical data of the number of bicycles in certain locations per hour you want to predict the number of icicles in future times at those locations what is in your opinion the best option go ahead again no dumb questions this is all about learning we don't know who answered what so and so you can answer whichever one you yes we're not going to like come back and be like why did you say this was the answer um I'm gonna go to the next one just in the interest of time or so the answer in the interest of time um linear regression is the best option out of these um you know there are other models that would work with but um but linear regression out of these is the correct answer um not overfitting definitely avoid overfitting as much as possible it's not clustering because you do have labeled data and it's not reinforcement learning because you have labeled data um the next example which I'm not sure if we have time to do the poll on this one um but that was just like climate policy documents right so your data set is of just a bunch of climate policy documents um and this is also a real paper um and uh yeah so uh you want to know just like what is in these documents you want to understand the vague General categories in these documents um and uh yeah so okay yeah um so for this one I'm just you know in the interest time we got like less than a minute left uh clustering would help you to understand the vague General categories here um but oh I see so it said uh yeah there there are other ways you know like I If you have another way of using the the data for another type of model that's wonderful um yeah so um but the what they what worked best here was clustering um just a quick note before we finish um on GPT because I know that's a really popular thing um GPT is a machine learning model that predicts the next word um right so the input is a sequence of words or just the start of sequence token and then the output is the next word right that's the model that it it does this um as mentioned before right there are a lot of drawbacks to this model right it's it's just predicting the next word based on what it's seen on the internet so that's you know that's going to make it you know do a bunch of stuff like hallucinate facts um they have shown this in their own report that it can hallucinate facts um it can also reproduce the social bias that it learned from the internet that it is trained on um otherwise here are the key takeaways um and uh yeah three types of learning two types of data and um where you can find the code thank you so much thank you Rasika are you still up for a couple more last questions and then we can call it a day all right sure so reinforcement learning meets a huge volumes of data and a lot of computation this consumes a lot of energy because of repeated reinforcement for AI obligations in climate change where data is to be analyzed in real time for alerts and forecasts is reinforcement learning a good approach to follow this is a great question that is a good question and I am not the expert on that um but uh I would say that like I mean depending on like how many like there are some models that you only train them once and then then after that like using the model is is less expensive right so depending on how much time it takes to train versus how many times you use it and how how much a compute it takes to use it um you know that could be taken into account um for like the actual emissions caused by the model but um yeah uh anyone feel free to jump in on this or ask the people in in that lecture on a few weeks I think in the in so we're gonna touch base on that but I think Lynn making an amazing point this morning there are codes of packages available to be able to track those carbon Footprints meanwhile you're coding and I would encourage people to start using them if they want to keep on um doing this sort of training last question thank you Jessica for your patience yeah when we talk about language modeling generally we're talking about supervised learning is there a reason to use unsupervised learning in language modeling no so yeah what I meant was self-supervised like it learns to predict the next word yeah yeah absolutely okay so there is no a reason for why not using unsupervised learning okay oh yeah no I mean you can use unsupervised learning in other ways for text but yes yeah all right well Rasika thank you so much for an amazing introduction to climate change it was super interesting it made me learn a few things again so that that was pretty great and thank you all for coming through and you know registering making super interesting questions I would largely encourage you to keep on looking at the community platform where we do had feedback forms happening then and those uh the count in for actually getting a certificate of completion for a climate change AI summer school so I would largely encourage you other than that the day is over thanks again and we'll see you next week thank you so much
