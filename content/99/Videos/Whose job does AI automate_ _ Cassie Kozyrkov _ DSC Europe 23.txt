introduction and uh yes I have the answer but uh but we'll get get there in a sort of Meandering Way good morning belg I am so happy to be here with you today and I have a quick question for the audience who here identifies themselves as an AI professional show of hands sh of hands okay I see some hands how about who does not identify as an AI professional all right a little more hands little more hands uh friends among the AI professionals do you know what year was the first year that the term artificial intelligence was used anybody we're going to have to do a little history here I think the answer is 1955 is 1956 for sure because in 1955 there was a fun Grant proposal being made and in this grant proposal was the first time that this term was used so I think that was written in 1955 but it was for a summer workshop in 1956 so what was the grant proposal for it was for a summer school session at dmouth in America uh that's a a university and a bunch of postdocs led by uh and postto or assistant professors I forget what they were at the time uh led by a fellow at MIT John McCarthy uh they wanted to get the funding to get together 10 of them to spend two months working on what they called in this ground proposal artificial intelligence now there are two fun facts about this situation which you might enjoy the first fun fact and I actually only learned this myself in October from someone who used to work directly with one of those 10 attendees the first fun fact is why that term is it because it is truly intelligent because we do get a lot of questions like are these things intelligent that name is a curse that comes from the grant proposal where it turns out that John McCarthy wrote that term in order to scare the US government into giving funding so that term was picked not because anybody particularly knew what intelligence was or how the human brain worked but rather because that term sounded intimidating and we're still living with some of the Legacy and baggage of that sometimes it uh stops organizations from being sensible in what to expect the other fun fact about the name artificial intelligence is that in that Grant proposal where it was first used the writers of The Proposal were planning to solve all of artificial intelligence with 10 people in two months in 1956 six so there is a legacy in this field of Big Talk which does not necessarily meet reality so maybe we should level set a little bit and uh reorient ourselves maybe what we should have called it if we wanted AI as an acronym is automated inspiration maybe that would have been a better term or Amplified impact which we're seeing a lot today or this year's move towards augmented individuals but really this is a story of automation so let's see automation at its most basic so what are we doing with a computer we're automating digitally we're turning inputs into outputs how how via a recipe so what's a recipe it's some code it's a model those are all fancy words for recipe takes the inputs turns them into outputs but we're going to need some Hardware here to do it the recipe is not enough we're going to need a computer and you are probably imagining this kind of computer but I want to show you a different kind of computer that's also a computer meet Dora and Dora is a computer now how do I know this because Dora happens to be my friend's wife's aunt and Dora was actually a computer here is her marriage certificate from 19 uh50 and you can see very clearly there that her profession is listed as computer so she is a real computer so we're going to have her in this example and what she's supposed to do is take an input and turn it into an output via some recipe now how does she know what to do right those of you who already work with computers those of you who are developers you know that a computer needs something very important which is an engineer to program the computer right and and luckily Dora has an engineer also because there you can see her husband's profession is listed as engineer so this is one of those early days in history where a computer has managed to marry her engineer now let's consider daora and her engineer husband back then in 1950 we want to get Dora to do a task like recognize whether an image has a cat in it or not this was a very classic computer vision task right the cat not cat task now one way in which we could do this is to figure out the exact instructions to give Dora of what to do with the input now consider what the input is the input is a bunch of pixel color values so it's a bunch of pixels and the question is what should you do with each pixel in an image to get the answer cat not cat right what is that recipe supposed to be and now you're thinking philosophical things like what makes a cat a cat difficult question right like what do you do with the top left hand pixel and the one next to it and what are you looking for in the image are you looking for triangles maybe two triangles maybe some ovals For Eyes this is a hard recipe to come up with and so in order to program a computer with instructions do this then do that then do that first you have to know how to do the task which you know how are you actually doing the task though you're doing it your brain is doing it but what are you actually doing with the pixels that is so hard to put into words you don't even know what you're doing so how on Earth are you going to program with the instructions of what to look for in each pixel very difficult now there's a different way that we could go about this instead of explaining what to do with each pixel you could instead explain your wishes with examples here are a bunch of examples of cat here are a bunch of examples of not cat you go find the patterns and then make a recipe automatically from those patterns so that you can take yourself from input to Output this examples versus instructions thing this is the essence of the difference between machine learning SL a and traditional programming and notice that we already do this with one another as humans sometimes we explain our wishes with examples sometimes we explain our wishes with instruction so we already teach one another one of these two ways now we are able to do the same thing with machines except we need fancy words for examples and instructions so we've got code is instructions and examples map to data so this really is the difference between the traditional software programming approach and the AI machine learning programming approach so let's make sure that we warm up this room and look at doing this cat not cat task together so I give you a bunch of inputs with their appropriate labels and then something in your brain figures out what those patterns are turns that into a recipe and then when the next one comes in you're going to take it and you're going to convert it to the output I'm looking for so to wake ourselves up we're going to play this game together I need each and every one of you to shout cat or not cat when I show you an input do you think you can do it yes you're not loud enough for me yes yes okay good right so here comes the first one cat someone said yes uh excellent working as intended so cat I agree with you cat see computers also make mistakes this is this is what what we will see as a theme here right this one I agree with you cat next not cat not cat [Laughter] cat what do I hear you saying big cat maybe cat these aren't allowable options we agreed it was either cat or not cat so it is this big cat maybe cat and you can't seem to agree which one it is huh troubling most troubling we begin to see what the leader and decision maker might be for in this situation this isn't one platonic right answer this isn't objective at all the right answer here depends very much on the purpose of the system what does it exist for and so I guess I'd better fill those big boots and I will tell you that this is supposed to be a pet recommendation system and so if it classifies something as a cat that had better be from the feline family and in its typical adult form safe to cuddle right let's try this again not cat and if you're still saying cat please take out more life insurance right I've seen some of those YouTube videos those uh those YouTube videos with the the three Tigers jumping into the back of the car those are not a good idea uh this is not a pet and let's not classify it as a cat now there are different applications and different situations in which you might actually want to classify that image as a cat it depends very much on what the system is for which brings me to our big topic which is data what we are doing here is we are automating our wishes using examples using data and we've all gone a little bit mad when it comes to data we pronounce it like it has a a capital D in it and we become so much more humble if we just say what this is which is examples written down in electronic form textbooks essentially for the machine student to learn from and data quality is everything if you're going to teach someone with examples the quality of those examples matters so much and none of this is purely objective same um meaning and answer every time as you can see depending on the purpose of the system whether the right answer is cat or not cat changes so data is a bunch of scraps of information that we happen to write down that we put in a textbook for for a machine to learn from like human textbooks normal textbooks for human students machine textbooks data sets have human authors they don't arrive from Aliens they don't come from nowhere from you know from the universe they are collected by us and they fit the sensibilities of whoever is in charge of the data process and the trouble with them of course is that they reflect unconscious things we might not even have considered could be a problem when we were authoring our textbooks so when you think about really old textbooks and you think whether you would want to teach your children from these really old textbooks from 200 years ago 300 years ago you're thinking absolutely not it doesn't matter what the title on the the cover of that textbook is chances are if you're trying to learn from it you're going to pick up some habits that are not good or useful habits so thinking about the quality of your textbook is really really important and can you complete the following sentence just to make sure that we're all on the same page garbage in garbage out you know this so what I find very very interesting about the data space the data professions data science I find fascinating about data science so when you go to a data conference or a data science conference sometimes I hang out with people I'll hang out with people after this as well if you want to hang out out there and sometimes folks come they hang out and they've got all different job roles so I'll ask them you know what do you do professionally one will say statistician and that one will be data engineer and that one will be clinical researcher and so on and then I like to do another round and I like to ask them okay who in your organization is responsible for data quality who who's in charge of it from data design documentation the cleanup all the way through to the um part where it starts hitting the pipelines that the data Engineers have built so who shapes the data set and what I love to hear here is that as we go around we have a very high correlation with whatever they said their own job title was so the statistician says statisticians are responsible for it the researchers say researchers are responsible for it data Engineers say data Engineers are responsible for it you know what that sounds like that sounds like a situation where it's everybody's job and therefore nobody's job in order to automate with data you need good and appropriate data in order to get good and appropriate data you need an expertise in a bunch of different topics you don't need to be a full expert in statistics for example but you need some expertise in statistics you need some understanding of data engineering some understanding of survey design human psychology if the data sets are about humans you need some uh user experience design if you are gathering that information online and how is the the way that you are presenting the questions in influencing the answers that you get back there's a lot of expertise you need and yet where is the job roll for this where is the profession that takes this seriously and I had a really terrible aha moment with this I was hanging out with a data science influencer as one does and um I was talking about how this is a problem that we are building our disciplines on a foundation of data and yet the quality of that data is no one's job I was thinking this is so important maybe instead of over focusing on this last mile thing maybe we should put more effort as a profession as an industry in the the first bit the actual data quality I'm saying we need to encourage University graduates to study this and to take this seriously there needs to be a career progression uh a way that motivates you to actually want to learn all those things to do it professionally because there's a lot to learn and then I ask this friend of mine and we're live streaming this is what makes it best we're live streaming in this moment I'm talking about it and I ask so what do you think we should what should this be called what is this called and my friend goes oh that sounds like a data janitor okay how is this how we're going to motivate our undergraduates to go to university and they're picking their major they're deciding what to study and then they call their parents and they say I've picked one I would like to go through a hard grueling training program to be a data janitor are you proud of me Mom and Dad right that's not a good start and it's not a good start when data seems to be everybody else's job so we have quite a brittle profession here because a lot of it is based on the hope that someone is going to do a job that they didn't train for and that we're almost surely not paying them properly for right we should worry about this and we should also remember that a lot of the data that we wish we had or the quality that we wish we had it at won't exist if we have this basic problem of Economics so that's first thing data are not objective they are subjective the design matters and even though we rely so much on data for automation there's not that good of a plan in the data professions so data quality is everything that is the first point I I really want to hammer home here and I know a lot of you in the audience think you've heard this all before and you get it but if you did wouldn't there be better progress in the industry to motivate fund and compensate people whose job the data quality actually is and then let's talk a little bit about the internet as a data source like that is a source of mirrors isn't it kind of reflects reality a little bit but you get a skewed perspective never forget that the internet is not reality how you behave online isn't how you behave in your natural surroundings and we know what kind of stuff lives on the internet in the parts where people can be anonymous right it's not necessarily bringing the best of us to anything so we need to be quite careful with what we allow ourselves to do on the basis of uh wild type data now back to our question of whose job AI automates let's look again at the uh broader category of AI by the way I'm using Ai and machine learning somewhat interchangeably here because I've given up Once Upon a Time AI used to be the superet then machine learning was the subset then at some point machine learning was the superet and AI was the subset something something if it's deep learning then it's AI I give up honestly there was a set of cycles of funding and disappointment appointment where you got the funding if you said Ai and then things didn't work out so then you started saying something else machine learning and then the funding didn't work out there and so we went up and down in these Cycles uh like bell bottoms and skinny jeans right like it's it's the fashion of what we're going to call it so actually my favorite definition of the difference between Ai and machine learning is if it is written in Python it's probably machine learning and if it's written in PowerPoint it's probably AI [Music] so I'm using them interchangeably the hell with it so whose job does AI automate let's look carefully at what this is as a automation proposition when I'm automating the traditional way first I have to know how to do the task so that I can explain to you what precisely you need to do with each input to get the output second I have to think about every little instruction and then I have to write it down and first I can write it down for my myself in pseudo code or you know English or whatever language I speak and then I have to translate it into something the computer can understand but I have to deal with every single line and maybe it takes 10,000 lines maybe it takes a 100,000 lines of code to automate my task I got to write each one down and you might be saying oh no maybe it's um maybe I just get a package somewhere I you know find some Library I install something and then I just pull from there and I don't have to write The Code by hand myself sure but some member of our species had to do it so some human is responsible for having thought through all those instructions whereas with machine learning and AI there are just two lines optimize this goal on that data set go now those of you who raised your hand for AI professional you know there's a lot more code that you're writing but that is because the tools are nasty at the core there are only these two lines of instructions what does success look like what data should we point this pattern finding thingy at and off we go and really if you had the ability to brute force it because you had enough computing power you could try every known algorithm with every permutation of it pretty much quickly eliminate some try everything out subject to just the two important lines of instruction optimize this goal on that data set and as the tools become easier and easier we will strip away all the huffing and puffing and the difficulty of forcing a data set in this format to be taken up by an algorithm uh that was designed over there you know some of these tools are are really it only a mother could love them and you're left with just these two lines which means that almost any anyone then will be able to automate a task huh what do we see here first two very subjective lines what is the goal of the system what does success look like why am I building this pet classifier that does cat not cat and why should tiger be labeled cat versus not cat or vice versa there's no one single right way to do that what about scoring mistakes that's all part of how we're going to um express our goal which mistakes are worse than which other mistakes again highly subjective and then which data set which textbook should we learn from there are a lot of different textbook choices you could use you could also edit and modify and get different versions of the textbooks and all of this is highly subjective but now available just two lines and you can automate your task how wonderful and how terrifying simultaneously this is both the Peril and the promise of AI the promise is if I'm doing a little task myself I can now automate very quickly how great for me I don't have to go and write everything from scratch but at the same time what if I am automating something on behalf of millions or billions of people what if my code's going to touch a lot of lives well then I can again without thinking too hard about it get it automated so we have a thoughtlessness enabler here we can be more Thoughtless and we can automate thoughtlessly which is great when it only affects you but when we start scaling that up we can do damage this is like a proliferation of magic lamps lamps with genies and knowing how to make a wish responsibly is a very important skill it's the skill of decision leadership we're not even talking about this though we're not asking ourselves who is it who has the skills on our team to figure out what success should look like how do we carefully State what we're looking for what do we actually want to create in the world and what would be the consequences if we got what we asked for and which data is appropriate and why and what would need to be true about that data for us to want to use it very very subjective questions that very few people are trained to answer so you should worry who is actually being tasked with doing this for massive systems do they have the skills to do it and as you see the tools get easier and easier you'll see a shift from a focus on Huff in and puffing and actually getting the data to be taken up by the algorithm and then deployed to production and a lot more focus on how do we put 10,000 lines or 100,000 lines of thought back into these two lines we've allowed ourselves to be thoughtless but on some things that's not okay so how do we put that thought back in how do we very carefully Design Systems that can affect society at scale but back to the question of whose job are we actually automating here well it is the developer's job right it we're going from having to write instructions to now being able to say instead of knowing how to do the task here's the objective here's the data go that said it's not like we're putting software developers out of business first there's still a lot of huffing and puffing to do to get the uh algorithms to accept those instructions and the data um second we are actually unlocking a whole class of new applications and all the old approaches are still going to be very economically necessary why if you are able to automate your task with instructions that is how you should do it that's how you get the most control if you're able to say what needs to be done in what order and you give those instructions to your machine or to your human employee you can be sure of what that person's going to do next if they're following the instructions exactly what you've told them to do no guessing no surprise ways that they interpreted anything just follow those instructions whereas if you know how to give the instructions but instead you give a few examples who knows what they're going to learn in those examples right good luck to you maybe they'll learn the right thing maybe they won't and mistakes are possible that's true with humans that's also true with these AI systems so why are we using them to automate things we can't automate the other way so we're not putting developers out of business everything developers used to do and used to be able to do you're still going to want to do that the old traditional way but now we've got a whole new class of applications and let's talk about a new new class of applications the two different AIS so this year we're talking a lot about AI we tend when we find ourselves hanging out with friends and having a glass of wine and talking about all these new things in Ai and 2023 we tend to be talking about generative AI so let's remind ourselves very quickly of the difference so discriminative AI the old one the one you're used to from uh last decade that is all about applying a label so this is a thing labeler we had the cat not cat example of that here's another classic uh again with vision so I really like this tweet it comes from BJ May who complained that he was locked out because his smart uh front door lock his his nest camera system locked him out because it was protecting him from Batman right it didn't want to let Batman in the house so it locked poor BJ May out so it's supposed to find the right answer it doesn't always work correctly right these systems do make mistakes and it's really important for designers to remember this because imagine what would have happened to poor BJ May if there wasn't a plan for mistakes he wouldn't have gotten back into his house instead he can put use a PIN to to get himself in because the engineers built that safety net and knew that mistakes were possible so that's thing labelers on the other hand generative AI is about creating a plausible Exemplar what do we learning not a label but a distribution and what can you do with a distribution is create a really good fake so this is a fake maker so as you all know Picasso is very famous for his paintings of laptops so I have some examples for you there in the uh top right hand corner this is where I'm using an image generation tool called mid Journey uh mid journey is my favorite casino I really enjoy playing with mid Journey it gives you you put in a prompt it gives you um four options back and maybe you like it maybe you rerun The Prompt until you get something that you like uh I've also created some fake Gucci sunglasses for you so both of these aren't you know it's not real Picasso this doesn't really uh exist out there we are generating from a distribution of plausible Picasso type and laptop type things uh to get this lovely fake for you so it's a game of plausible exemplars and people ask a question that bugs me so much when they see this stuff they ask can AI be creative does this mean that AI is the artist is AI making art and then I have to remind folks of an entire Century of art history because if you're asking questions like this you must have missed something from art history from the 20th century so let's go back to 1917 Marcel deson found this iconic piece this is considered iconic in the art world it's a UR urinal he signed some name on it not even his own name he took it to the exhibition went that's art and it was we consider this a very interesting piece it's worth a lot is it art sure why because art is a conversation that humanity is having with itself and has been having for Millennia and to make art you are trying to have the next word of the next sentence in this Grand conversation but who is the artist I would say Dam let's give him credit because otherwise where are we going to put the credit on the porcelain makers the toilet company that doesn't make any sense to me and should we penalize him because he didn't sculpt it from scratch match mixing his own materials creating his own porcelain not at all this cut out a lot of toil and allowed him to say what he wanted to say much faster chair of AI plays the same role like a paintbrush it's a tool for you to be able to say what you need to say faster and better and the secret behind a lot of these generative AI art things is that it's very rare that the first one is the one that's presented to the A audience so AI made art that won some art competition no that was like the 8,000th iteration a person cranked the handle on these tools 8,000 times 500 times however many times it took to get the one that they were looking for to express what they wanted to express so where's the creativity it's in the human but the human can go a little bit faster they don't need to mix paints we don't penalize artists today for not mixing their own Paints the way that they would have in the Middle Ages making their own paint brushes out of horse hair or whatever it is you go to the shop you buy some paint brushes you buy some paint and you go paint that's great that lets us get there faster and that's what generative AI allows you to do as well what are some other things you can do so good old open AI uh all over the news it's open chat GPT I have in audiences like this I have asked who here has never used chat GPT and so I'm going to stop embarrassing audiences because there does tend to be one hand and then I ask okay who here has never read about chat GPT and that no hands go up and I think what a strange equation it is faster to try it than to read about it so why did my one hand one or two hands read about it without trying it you may as well just try it the interface is super easy it's like sending a text message and you type whatever you want to type uh this is when we asked CEOs what they personally use Chan gbt for the most one of the favorite answers was to write a retirement poem or a birthday poem so uh you know it's it's really getting used for its um its top applications but here I've asked it to write a funny retirement poem for your CEO in the style of Dr Seuss and what does it give us back you've been the big cheese the head of the pack now it's your time to kick back and slack right so uh definite L the highest in um what we could possibly want out of our technology let's try another one this is a a an application that open AI found and noticed was a statement perhaps about The Human Condition so a lot of people like to take bullet points and then ask open AI uh chat GPT to turn that into an email a full email so here are some summaries expand that out into an email and what I found was that this was apopular use case as was this other use case which was summarize this email as bullet points back into the original so I think that that uh does tell us something a little bit uh sad and funny about how humans work wouldn't it be great if all of our emails could just be bullet points in the first place but what we're seeing here with generative AI is a new kind of user interaction it is AI as a raw material AI for ai's sake given to you the user to do anything you want with next so we have the ability to find the right distributions to pull laptops by Picasso out or Gucci sunglasses or whatever else you want but now we're giving you the tool you figure out what you want to shape it into and when we talk about regulating generative AI I hope you can appreciate now how hard this is because we are not good at regulating Ro materials even physical raw materials whose fault is it if I invent a phenomenal anti-gravity material that could be pretty cool for Humanity but some idiots going to make skis out of it so whose fault is it then when they go and ski in anti-gravity ski isn't hurt themselves was it me for making the material was it whoever helped them fashion the skis was it then the user of those skis who is responsible how do we limit what the uses of it are that would be okay versus not okay this is a hard problem hard with physical materials when it comes to digital raw materials good luck really hard to figure out how to regulate and when I hear that a problem is really hard the last thing that I want is for us then to solve it in some dumb way just to say we've solved it so we can move on in our to-do list solving AI regulation here is difficult which means that maybe we shouldn't get ahead of ourselves and make a bunch of laws we haven't thought through maybe go slowly and think about the consequences of regulating maybe request a bunch of information that would help you regulate it later so it is a very very difficult problem then another kind of application is all kinds of translation type stuff so here I have asked it to write the Fortran code for generating the Fibonacci sequence and I do not speak or understand Fortran so hopefully someone in the room can look at this and see if it's right or not what I can do is I know with the Fibonacci sequences and I can write out those instructions I could also have written them out the way that I want and ask for it to translate that to foran but here's a little quick bit of trouble anyone here G to fess up G to confess with me that you don't speak foran anybody right so I'm seeing some hands so imagine that we asked for this lovely for Trend code for generating the Fibonacci sequence and we get it do we take this and plug this directly into our code base when we don't understand what the hell it is terrifying so with this one okay maybe we have we know how to be software Engineers I would figure out how to make some unit tests here maybe I would line by line try to figure out what I'm looking at but you can see the more code that I generate with this in languages that I don't speak or understand the more space I'm leaving for potentially catastrophic disasters as I plug this into an already complicated system this is why people are saying that good developers are becoming much better the estimates coming from McKenzie of 50% better if you're a good engineer then this can cut out a lot of drudgery but bad Engineers are becoming worse and bad teams are reducing corporate productivity because they're plugging all kinds of nonsense into their systems so in general here people who are already highly productive are making themselves more productive they understand the output they understand how to put it together into Solutions but those who are on the less productive side or they don't know what they're working with or they just believe AI is Magic and they plug things in where they shouldn't they are reducing everybody's productivity so that's that's a point worth thinking about and I wonder if it would surprise anybody here that I do not in fact speak Serbian so imagine if I had a really really important email that I needed to write to someone in Serbian where I really care about my reputation and that relationship so I just go straight to open aai I ask for that email to be translated I get something out of there and I send it what a disaster that could be maybe it's correct but if I have no way of checking it I'm going to have problems and this brings us to why why it's so difficult to scale generative AI in the Enterprise to use it for personal productivity and to make an individual responsible for the output is quite an easy one if you already have a smart and productive person but when you think about taking the person out of the loop and then at scale automating some processes remember these systems do make mistakes it may be hard for humans to check it may be hard to even define whether that output was right or not so how do you set up at scale this kind of automation from now on we're automatically going to write all our emails in Serbian with this system well you g to you're going to have to test the hell out of it and that's what a lot of companies don't know how to do so no wonder we're getting this bottleneck in Enterprise automation and so when should you trust an AI system there are two paths to trust the human in the loop model so make the human individually responsible and treat that as individual productivity increases or a hell of a lot of safety testing and safety nets and as always it is safest to have both we're still so excited in what you potentially could do that we end up in organizations with death by a thousand Pilots get mandates from the top saying everybody go find two three use cases and everybody go try plug this into your business and then take the human out of the loop too they don't know how to do testing though they don't know how to build the safety nets they've removed the human in the loop and then they wonder why their use cases don't work I do think that we're going to have a lot more generative AI at scale but this is the part to figure out in fact I'm a recovering statistician and uh recovering also because we are the grumpiest of the data scientist and we've sort of been folded into the data science profession for a bit definitively the um you know less popular sibling in that family for now and I cackle to myself slightly because statisticians are going to have to be back aren't they someone's going to have to figure out does this thing in fact work the way that we think it works someone's going to have to figure out the testing testing is still the most difficult part especially in generative Ai and here is a little analogy that I encourage folks who are not in this business to really internalize the data are like the ingredients the algorithms are like appliances in in a kitchen when we were talking about doing applied AI last decade we were talking about innovating in models in recipes so creating a croissant that is sugar- free and gluten-free and dairy free and delicious how do you go about making a recipe like that you get a bunch of ingredients you get the appliances and then you Tinker you dabble you play you hope you do a bunch of taste testing you get your croissant or cookie or whatever it is you start being able to produce them at scale how wonderful now with the generative AI Revolution it's equivalent to saying instead of I give all of you the cookie that I've made and you can eat it or not eat it right here right now and you don't have to worry about where it comes from instead I'm saying here get access to my cookie maker the cookies and take them and turn them into whatever you want anything creative Valentine's Day baskets spray painted gold call it art whatever you want to do but you see that we do lose an interesting layer of control there because we have a separation in this system from whatever the dish was to however you're going to use it and the users down the line of these products you are not told very much about where those ingredients came from how they got processed what their quality was what were those appliances what even went on in that kitchen is it poisonous isn't it well you're going to have to test everything yourself again from scratch if you're a downstream user trying to do this at Enterprise scale for tasks that matter for some tasks though truly take a thing spray painted gold what do you care what the ingredients were it looks about right now it's gold and it still looks about right everything's good but where the ingredients might have mattered where the qual quality might have mattered it's up to you to figure out the testing and finally leaving you with the thought of who job AI will automate as a consequence yes it is about engineering and automation but as a consequence of these Technologies what are we going to see in the US what we are seeing is the second quartile um taking the most having the most effect taking the most economic damage from these Technologies is the second quarti of skill level and income and this is puzzling economists why not the people at the very bottom the least skilled labor and why not the most skilled labor well I have a guess what's happening in the second quartile is the tasks that are most repetitive and most digitized if it's repetitive and digitized if it's copy pasting if it's doing things things on mental screen saver with a computer those are the tasks that are most likely to be uh rendered no longer necessary for humans to do whereas the difficult skills of having Taste of being creative of thinking of problem solving of being a great engineer those skills and those jobs are still extremely important no matter how good your tools get but there is a small economic issue here which could become a very big one what we take for granted is how our young people become our senior trusted leaders artists developers managers Etc nobody trusts someone fresh out of University right I I don't do you so what is what does that path look like from newly graduated to senior and trusted often a bunch of easy to measure output that's pretty repetitive a bit mindless you understand the person's character by working with them you see if they go a little outside the box but mostly you give them very low trust tasks exactly the kind of tasks that are going to get automated here and what you will see is that bosses leaders are now going to absorb a lot of the work that their junior staff members would have done great in the short term how are you going to get the next generation of bosses though what is your plan for developing your talent to a point where you can trust them because the skills that are most likely to get left are those skills where you need to apply some taste where you need to be trusted where you need to have judgment and good sense and expertise and where when you look at the code or you look at the output or you you look at the art you are able to judge whether that's what you're looking for right if I never learn how to speak Serbian how am I going to deal with that email output in seran how we're going to incentivize me to learn the language whether it's a programming one or a human one to get to the point where I'm able to supervise the functioning of these systems rather than do the task myself this is a big piece that is missing in our economic plans globally and so as you if you are beginning to automate with these systems in your organizations as you're taking responsibility for this please pay attention to the three big topics from this talk one data quality matters and today it's nobody's job that's a problem two testing these things is difficult especially when we're talking about generative AI at scale without humans in the loop and and three it's going to be up to you to create that plan for how you're going to be able to train your staff and not leave anyone out because your most valued staff members the ones you really do want to have around often need that part of going through a gauntlet that these tools uh May render less attractive in the short term and that's why we have a term like secret cyborgs in America so people who want to use these tools they don't want their managers to know that should be a warning it should be a warning that we don't trust managers to handle that transition fairly carefully and responsibly and so how do we in this room think about championing a gentle and also effective and intelligent way through the challenges of today to get to a highly productive economy and Workforce tomorrow thank you very much thank you
