# Documentation Writing

## Converting implementation notes to clear references people can use.

After finishing a technical task, I use AI to turn my notes into clear documentation. It keeps explanations consistent and readable, bridging the gap between the technical and the human layer of a project.

#### Replace — Verification Step (N-115)

I added a model‑assisted verification step to grade claims and cite sources before publishing. Grounded assessment raised trust in generated research and docs.

# Ensembling Models

## Raising reliability by reconciling multiple models into one action.

Combining multiple providers or model families changes reliability. Instead of betting on one model, ask several to answer the same prompt, then reconcile. Agreement raises confidence; disagreement exposes assumptions to investigate.

#### Signals Ensemble (N-101)

I built an ensemble for our Signals flow to query models in parallel and aggregate outputs. The system de‑duplicates near‑matches, clusters themes, and preserves provenance so we can trace where ideas came from.

#### Merge — Ensemble Validation (N-105)

After aggregation, a validation pass checks claims across sources and flags conflicts. The goal is not consensus for its own sake but grounded action with a verification plan.
