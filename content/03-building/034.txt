# Increased Capabilities




One way to think about why we use centaurs is that it helps extend our capabilities. It grows our capacity to do different things and upskills us in areas we could barely imagine. We'll look at a few examples of that.

The gain is not necessarily at the upper edge of intelligence or capability. If you imagine a skill distribution like a normal distribution, you are probably on the right side of a handful of skills, whether it's leadership, research, or whatever you do very well. But there are many things where most of us are on the left or in the middle. That's where we see the biggest gain.
Don't ask the AI to do what you do well; evaluate its capability. The likelihood is it isn't as good as you if you're good at it, but it gets you up to average quickly. For all the stuff you're mediocre at, AI can significantly upskill you. This is where the majority of the benefit lies: getting people up to average quickly and bumping up the right side of higher skills. However, the latter seems to be a lower priority right now compared to getting people up to average.

The Economic Impacts of Frontier Artificial Intelligence on Digital Platforms
The study examined the impact of ChatGPT on labor market outcomes for freelancers on two digital platforms, Zhubajie (ZBJ) and Upwork, focusing on writing and programming tasks.
After ChatGPT's release, the number of completed writing jobs on ZBJ decreased by 31.6%, and the average price dropped by 4.5%.
On Upwork, the number of completed writing jobs decreased by 21.7%, and the average price dropped by 6.3% post-ChatGPT.
For programming tasks, the number of completed jobs decreased by 13.8% on ZBJ and 16.5% on Upwork, while the average price dropped by 3.2% on ZBJ and 3.5% on Upwork.
Higher-skilled freelancers (top 10% in earnings) experienced larger negative impacts compared to lower-skilled freelancers.





# how can people combine their intelligence with computers

There are several ways that people can combine their intelligence with computers:

- Human-computer collaboration: This involves working together with a computer program to achieve a common goal. For example, in chess, a human player may use a computer program to analyze different positions and help them make decisions.

- Human-in-the-loop: This approach involves using a computer to assist with certain tasks, but with a human overseeing the process and making the final decisions. For example, in image recognition, a computer may be able to identify objects in a picture, but a human may be needed to verify that the objects are correctly identified.

- Human-computer interaction: This involves using a computer as a tool to enhance human capabilities. For example, in education, a computer program may be used to provide personalized learning experiences and to give students instant feedback on their progress.

- Human-computer co-creation: This approach involves working together with a computer to create something new. For example, in the field of music composition, a computer program may be used to generate new melodies, but a human composer may be needed to arrange them into a coherent piece of music.

- Human-computer augmentation: This approach is based on the idea that computers can enhance human cognitive capabilities. For example, a computer program that can assist with memory recall and organization, can help people with memory impairments.

Overall, the key to effectively combining human intelligence with computer intelligence is to find ways to leverage the strengths of both in order to achieve a common goal.
