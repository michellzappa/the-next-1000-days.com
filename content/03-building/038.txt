Netflix's first big push into custom programming was a $100M bet supported by audience preference data used to support creative decisions.

This concept is a bit like what Netflix did when they purchased the rights to "House of Cards" 15 or so years ago. They were moving into custom programming and streaming. The big bet was to license a couple of series from abroad, produce them locally, and maximize their chances of success by using big data and machine intelligence in a pre-AI way.

By leveraging all available data sources, Netflix took a traditionally creative process and made it data-driven.

Before producing "House of Cards," they made several creative decisions based on viewers' data, such as director, actors, and even color palette. This was a clear success and was replicated for other productions.

However, the VP of content mentioned that it's still two-thirds gut. You can't rely entirely on data; you still have to balance it with intuition. 



Investment in original programming skyrocketed thanks to the success of House of Cards and other data-driven productions.


Netflix's investment in custom programming has not slowed down. There was a quick drop post-COVID, but they have continued investing in producing content on a larger scale, and we expect this to keep happening.
