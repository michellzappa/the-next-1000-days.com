# Product Design Reasoning

## Reasoning through behavior before pixels to reduce rework.

I use AI to reason through how a product should behave before it’s designed. I describe the user’s intent, steps, and possible confusion points, and it helps expose friction early. This conversational prototyping clarifies purpose before any interface exists.

#### Replace — Co‑building Signals (N-099)

I built our Signals tool with ChatGPT and Claude across many iterations. The end‑to‑end cycle—requirements, prototypes, refactors—proved more persuasive than abstractions. Iteration volume was the surprise: stability came after several full rewrites.

#### Sidebar — Purpose Web (N-043)

If space allows, include a brief web angle to complement the mobile POC. Avoid duplication; keep to the reasoning that shaped scope.
