# Interface Sketching

## Prototyping flows in words to test logic before UI.

When outlining an app or webpage, I explain the user flow and ask AI to translate it into interface logic—what each screen should do, what happens next, how feedback loops might work. It’s a way to test functionality in words before pixels.

#### Merge — Build Experiments (N-028)

Sustained prototyping across versions raised specificity. Each loop clarified requirements and risks, turning vague sketches into stable flows.

#### Merge — Generative Patterns (N-104)

Generative interfaces need new primitives: hand‑offs, correction loops, uncertainty displays. Naming these patterns improves design conversations and tests.
