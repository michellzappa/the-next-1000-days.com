Freestyle, or centaur chess emerged when Kasparov and fellow players created the first chess championship where computers were welcome.

In reality, Kasparov went back to the drawing board and only a year later, he organized the first championship of something called advanced chess or freestyle chess. Instead of playing against a computer, you play with a computer against another human-computer pair. In Le√≥n, Spain, the first game of advanced chess was played. Kasparov described it as both disturbing and exciting.
