# Superintelligence

We're nowhere near that, but we're getting there. There are all these capability curves where at level zero, we have no AI, and we work all the way up to a superintelligence, which is defined as an intelligence that outperforms every single human. I think currently, we're somewhere near level three or four, where we have expert-level AIs, maybe virtuosos. These AIs are better than 99% but not always outperforming everyone. We are still way more intelligent in many more things than the current crop of AIs, but we see where the puck is heading, so to speak.
