# Timeline for AGI

image163-351.webp

Prediction markets suggest that AGI will likely be developed and publicly announced by 2032.

A secondary peak around  2100 reflects that many believe it's still beyond our lifetimes.

Others might suppose AGI isnâ€™t already tipping the scale and skewing our predictions ðŸ‘€.

Experts or rather prediction markets think that we'll have AGI in the next decade. The current prediction on Metaculus is around 2032. This again becomes entirely a question of how we define AGI and how we even know we have it. It's definitely something to keep observing because there's great division even between people building these systems as to how capable they actually are. I'm not here to resolve that but rather to throw some attention on it.
