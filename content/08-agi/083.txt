# Vectors of Intelligence
## Capability Dimensions

Intelligence is not a single, monolithic capability but a combination of various dimensions, spanning across different levels from task-specific abilities to broad.

To develop truly intelligent systems, a comprehensive approach addressing all these vectors is crucial, ensuring balanced progress across all dimensions.

4. Capability Dimensions of Intelligence
   - Overview of Joscha Bach's capability vectors
   - The multifaceted nature of intelligence (perception, reasoning, learning, etc.)
   - Challenges in replicating human-like general intelligence

Joscha Bach, one of my favorite thinkers in the space, talks a lot about capability dimensions. Here are his capability dimensions: this is based on other research, but basically, we're not capable in a single direction. We have skills in a single direction, but we're capable at a much larger scale. We have to be embodied; we have to have perception, reason, learn, represent, self-knowledge, language, and the ability to collaborate. For an AGI to be generally intelligent, it should be capable in all these directions.
