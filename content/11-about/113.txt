# Newsletter 
## Artificial Insights: weekly newsletter and community of experts.

- Newsletter & Community documenting our transition toward AGI.
- Features CEO interviews, podcasts, lectures, and commentary on what's happening in AI.

Every Monday morning, I hit "publish" on another issue of *Artificial Insights*. The goal is simple: to keep pace with the flood of AI developments, without getting swept up in the hype. This newsletter is a way for me—and for all of us—to stay grounded while the world spins faster and faster around the advances in artificial intelligence. It’s a way to filter through the noise and focus on what really matters, what’s useful, and what’s worth paying attention to. We’re all in the thick of this, and we need clarity more than we need sensationalism.

I’ve been tracking the transition toward AGI for some time now. The promise of AI has always been out there—decades of slow, incremental advances followed by a sudden explosion of applications. We went from wondering if AI would be useful in our lifetime to realizing that it’s reshaping industries in real-time. The speed of that transition has been staggering. But the focus here isn’t just on the technology; it’s on what AI actually means for people like us who are navigating this shift. What happens when automation becomes so integrated into daily workflows that we stop noticing it? How do we decide which technologies to adopt and which to ignore? These are the questions I explore every week, and they are the reason this newsletter exists.

I started writing this to document that transition in a way that felt grounded in real experiences, not abstract predictions. Sure, we’re moving toward AGI, and while that’s an exciting—or terrifying—prospect, it’s also easy to get lost in the grandiosity of it all. *Artificial Insights* is about keeping it practical, understanding the tools we have now, and seeing how they fit into the broader picture of our professional and personal lives. I don’t claim to know where this is all going, but I’m convinced it’s worth paying close attention to the small steps as much as the big leaps.

The readership of this newsletter shares a few things in common, even if they come from different industries and backgrounds. They are curious, forward-thinking, and more importantly, they are *active* participants in this transition. Some are already experimenting with AI in their daily work, finding ways to integrate generative models into creative projects, business processes, or decision-making. Others are just trying to make sense of where this technology fits into their future plans. What unites them is a shared understanding that AI isn’t something that can be ignored. Whether we like it or not, it’s becoming central to everything we do.

One of the reasons I write this newsletter is to offer a break from the relentless hype that surrounds AI. There’s fatigue in the air—AI fatigue, media fatigue, news fatigue. The sheer volume of information can be overwhelming, and the constant speculation about where AI is headed often feels more exhausting than enlightening. This community—my readers—are looking for more than just the latest product launch or the next overhyped prediction. They want to see how these tools can be applied in meaningful ways, how they can reshape workflows, and ultimately, how they can be used to create something better, not just faster.

I’ve always been fascinated by the gap between what’s possible and what’s actually happening in the AI space. There’s so much focus on the potential of AGI, and yet, we’re only just beginning to understand how AI can transform the most mundane parts of our daily work. In many ways, that’s what I’m most interested in: the small, incremental changes that AI brings to how we do things. The big breakthroughs—AGI, autonomous agents, machines outthinking humans—are exciting, but the real impact, at least right now, is in how we use these tools to make our current work more efficient, creative, or insightful. That’s where the magic happens, in the margins of our daily routines.

What I’ve found, and what keeps me writing week after week, is that this community—the readers of *Artificial Insights*—are deeply engaged in that process. They’re not passive observers waiting for AGI to arrive; they’re participants in this transformation. Some are educators, exploring how AI can change the way we teach and learn. Others are entrepreneurs, figuring out how to leverage automation in ways that give them an edge. Many are technologists, but just as many are from fields that wouldn’t traditionally be associated with AI: creative industries, public policy, healthcare, design. The unifying thread is curiosity and a willingness to experiment.

In many ways, this newsletter has become a space for collective exploration. It’s not just me documenting my experiments or thoughts on AI. It’s become a dialogue, a conversation with people who are equally invested in figuring out what comes next. I’ve had readers write in with their own experiments—whether they’re using GPT to draft business proposals, or building small-scale AI tools to augment their workflows. That back-and-forth, the shared learning, is what makes this work so rewarding. It’s not just about tracking the transition to AGI; it’s about navigating that transition together.

Ultimately, this newsletter is about making sense of AI’s role in our everyday lives. Not the distant future where machines outthink us, but the present, where AI is reshaping how we work, create, and think. The transition toward AGI is fascinating, yes, but what matters right now is how we apply what’s already here. How do we experiment with these tools in ways that add value? How do we move beyond fear or hype and start using AI in ways that are practical, creative, and meaningful?

This is why I keep writing. It’s why I spend hours every week experimenting with the latest tools, reading the latest papers, and trying to piece together what it all means. And it’s why this community keeps growing. We’re all trying to figure out where AI fits into our lives, our work, and our futures. And for now, at least, we’re doing it together.
