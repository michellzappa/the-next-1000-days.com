How do you think about technology futures?

I've spent 15+ years analyzing the cutting edge of technology, and worked in research, strategy and consulting for clients worldwide. Mostly, that means helping people understand which questions to ask.

I write and speak about areas of research I'm trying to understand, publish a weekly newsletter and give presentations pulling together these ideas.
