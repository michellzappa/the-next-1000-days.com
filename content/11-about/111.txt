## Terms and concepts to understand AI 

I have been consumed by a research project mentioned earlier, the creation of an index of AI related concepts and terminology. A significant aspect of learning a subject is knowing the terms used to define the field. AI has evolved to include hundreds of ideas over the decades, and it seems we each know a small part of the whole. It turns out LLMs have tremendous self-knowledge, so I have been leveraging lots of GPT to develop and fact-check over 200 AI-related concepts and terms. Currently published as an Obsidian vault, and we are also working on non-linear methods for visualizing and navigating these ideas. 

The primary reason Iâ€™m doing this is to help more people learn about the theory underpinning the largest technological revolution of our lifetimes, and maybe help us make sense of what we are experiencing.
