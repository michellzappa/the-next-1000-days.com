# Seven principles for thinking like a Centaur

### Think in Dialogue

> Intelligence changes when it becomes conversational. Instead of writing for later revision, the centaur writes to see thought unfold in real time. Dialogue reveals assumptions faster than silence ever could. By letting language loop between human and model, the mind learns to observe itself thinking.

### Describe Before You Decide

> In hybrid work, clarity precedes action. The quality of output depends on the precision of description. Before asking for help or direction, centaurs describe the situation fully — not to control the machine, but to understand the problem. Decision follows articulation.

### Externalize Thought

> Much of human reasoning stays implicit, tangled in intuition. AI becomes a way to make inner logic visible. Writing out what you believe — and watching it mirrored or challenged — turns reflection into feedback. The centaur habit is to think in the open, not the head.

### Slow the Loop

> Speed is seductive, but insight comes from rhythm. Centaurs learn to pause between prompt and response, reading not only what the model says but how it reframes the question. The space between iterations is where discernment forms.

### Treat Neutrality as a Mirror

> AI has no stake, preference, or fatigue. Its neutrality can be unsettling, but also clarifying. It reveals bias by contrast — what you keep repeating, what you avoid, what you overstate. A centaur uses the model’s evenness as a tool for self-awareness.

#### Stay the Author

> Delegation is not abdication. The machine can generate, rephrase, even surprise, but intent must remain human. The centaur’s authorship lies in curation — in knowing which ideas to keep, refine, or discard. Authority is not lost; it’s redistributed across the dialogue.

### Reflect on the Reflection

> Hybrid intelligence is recursive. Every exchange teaches you as much about yourself as about the machine. Over time, the process becomes a mirror of thought, patience, and growth. The centaur practice is not just to ask — it’s to learn from the act of asking.
