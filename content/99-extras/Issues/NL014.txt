One of the reasons I decided to publish Artificial Insights was always having an excuse to experiment with automation myself. Like most people spending significant time on their computers, over the years I have toyed with scripts, macros and code to help facilitate workflows or simply for the sake of learning.

Some readers ask me if the newsletter is written by an AI – and while it still isn’t – it makes sense to create a personal workflow optimizing for what I want to spend more (or less) time on. Writing is a form of learning, so I’m not interested in ceding this regular opportunity for synthesis to automation – at least not entirely. Having explored a few of approaches for speeding up my workflow, I’m now using Zapier to turn YouTube links using Raindrop into summarized descriptions with links in a Google Doc, and another for arbitrary links to articles. This enables tagging a link on any platform for review and editing, which helps me spend more watching and learning and less time juggling links.

This issue covers the usual array of memes, perspectives and explainers around AI with an eye towards AGI. If this resonates or if you have profiles or links to share, please always reach out.
