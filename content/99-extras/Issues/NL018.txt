This week’s newsletter attempts to showcase some of the big ideas shaping the unfolding area of creative AI. The integration of computational creativity into our workflows is not just a diversion, it's becoming a cornerstone of all kinds of thinking. The value of AI isn't merely in automating tasks but in augmenting human capabilities to think beyond traditional boundaries. It's like adding another layer to the mind's canvas, granting us more shades of creativity than we thought possible. 
The concept of centaurs in AI takes this collaboration a step further, suggesting a symbiosis between machine learning algorithms and human intuition. This idea builds on the belief that while AI excels in crunching numbers and identifying patterns at a scale impossible for humans, it lacks the emotional intelligence, ethics, and nuanced understanding that come naturally to us. On the flip side, humans can't process vast amounts of data or perform complex calculations in milliseconds. When you combine these different kinds of intelligence—algorithmic and human—you get a "centaur": an entity that harnesses the strengths of both its components, akin to the mythical creature that's part horse and part human. Such a pairing is already revolutionizing not just how we approach problems, but also how we innovate, empathize, and change as a society.
