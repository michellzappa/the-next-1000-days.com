Happy Monday and welcome to your weekly download of faster, higher and stronger memes.

It is remarkable how not a week goes by without significant releases and announcements happening in the AI space. How many of these are worth your attention is arguable, but I don’t have the impression that the rate of change is about to slow down. 

On the contrary, there are relatively few places unaffected by the onslaught of AI news. Everywhere we look there are new attempts and applications trying to persuade us into automating or augmenting our abilities. Some think these will plateau, others believe we are only yet scratching the surface.

Regardless of how this pans out in our lifetimes, I am delighted to be sharing these learnings with you, and a growing number of readers. Establishing my tone & pace in such a technical and rapidly changing environment is a balancing-act, which makes me all the more surprised so many of you are jumping on board.

Below is a full day’s worth of listening from the people actually building AI – I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!

Until next week,MZ
