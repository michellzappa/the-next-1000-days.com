It occurred to me that ChatGPT and its kin have probably already crossed the threshold of believability, which means they have beaten the Turing Test. I suppose there are infinite permutations of what exactly qualifies as demonstrating abilities indistinguishable from human, but for all practical purposes we are now in a post-Turing reality, where generative text, images, audio and video are inseparable from human-made content. No fanfare – only the slow collective realization that something irreversible has taken place. Without instructions or guidance we are all fractionally responsible for directing the course of development. As a reader, you are the ideal candidate for picking up the banner of responsible AGI and promoting an equitable path forward.

This week’s edition is again video-heavy, with insights about the future of AI and education from Khan Academy, an in-depth interview with the chief scientist of OpenAI, and opinions about the limitations of AI.
