Happy Monday and welcome to your weekly map to the boundaries of artificial awakenings. 

Like the past 42 weeks of publishing this newsletter, this one has been a whirlwind of news in the rapidly evolving AI space. I sometimes feel compelled to look away a couple of cycles and simply let things unfold,Â but without fanning the hype, I am increasingly convinced that this field is a unilateral transformative force affecting more-or-less every aspect of our individual & collective lives. 

I mean â€“ why would you go back?

Short of a Great Revolt, there is no viable path back from our collective acceptance of advanced technologies to a prior state. We are ratcheting up our dependence on tech towards greater and greater mutual benefit. There is no reversing course.

Instead, consider different pathways forward. Lean in to certain technologies, learn about them in depth, and figure out how to use them in your daily life. GenAI is here and only getting better. Learn its boundaries and strenghts. Figure out what makes it tick, and which bits of your work are worth augmenting. Do this for yourself and for the benefit of those around you. 

For me, it means rekindling the love of capturing ideas as visual images, which has translated into hundreds of hours crafting DallE & MidJourney prompts in the last year, for example. No better way to move towards new skills than doing what you truly enjoy. 

On a practical note, donâ€™t miss our new WhatsApp group chat ðŸ’¬. Thanks to readers like you, this has now become my favorite place to find and share new ideas. Hope to see you there.
Until next week,MZ
