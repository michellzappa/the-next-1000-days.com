Each week of publishing this newsletter has provided an opportunity to reflect on the news, experiment with cutting-edge AI tools, and find an audience that resonates with these insights.

Staying on top of AI is endlessly rewarding, and the combination of upgrading virtually any personal skill, used together with the apps and frameworks that are integrating language models, feels like a completely new paradigm of computing. As someone who grew up through the digital revolution, I have always molded my work and personal learning modes around technology. This makes me especially sensitive to the fact that technology deeply shapes our reality. From warfare to industrial development to professional abilities – the very concepts of value and evolution are deeply tied to technological capacity. I am not convinced this is a “good thing” but recommend acknowledging the implications. 

My approach for making the most of such a situation has always been by sharing personal learnings and helping others sharpen their own insight around the subject. This weekly publication helps me keep a drumbeat of observations and hopefully helps you keep the subject present.
Another approach is the masterclass I have been working on and which has been mentioned in previous issues. The session is finally ready to share and I’d love to open it up to with the community.
