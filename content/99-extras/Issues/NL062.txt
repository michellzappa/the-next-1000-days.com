Happy Monday and welcome to your regular reboot of ambitious information.

Whether we are progressing towards artificial super intelligence or not, it feels certain that the effects of AI will keep regularly advancing. In the short term we will probably feel underwhelmed and sometimes surprised – whereas in the longer term AI will significantly rewrite parts of our social order. I don’t enjoy fueling hype, yet can’t arrive at any different conclusion from observing the news reaching my filter bubble every day.
This week’s issue hopes to expand your understanding of what AI is capable of and where we are going. There are countless experts in the field, and it is sometimes difficult to navigate the ecosystem, but I hope this weekly curation of insights to be as helpful for you as it has been for me.

Until next week,MZ
