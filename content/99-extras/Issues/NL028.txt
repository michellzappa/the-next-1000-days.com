Last week, like so many others, saw an array of developments from the AI companies we have come to know. Humane launched a wearable AI pin and OpenAI launched GPT-4 Turbo and GPTs. While this isnâ€™t the place to discuss particular corporate announcements, but rather track the big picture and direction of change, itâ€™s noteworthy when some of the fastest-growing tech companies are launching products that are both better and more affordable year over year.

Like in previous weeks, I have been experimenting a ton, especially with ChatGPT. This includes launching a very experimental GPTarot.ai ðŸŽ´ where you can ask GPT to pull three cards and maybe give you a sense of direction. Check it out! The entire web app was developed alongside ChatGPT, including the card designs, technical assistance and troubleshooting. As a non-programmer itâ€™s remarkable how having access to these tools has changed my expectation of what is possible, and there is no reversal in sight.
