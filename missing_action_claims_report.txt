Missing action claims from newsletters with proposed book locations

## Tone
Your text is calm and precise, but sometimes almost too composed. Sprinkle in a few vivid moments:
	•	The first time GPT surprised you.
	•	A time when it clearly saved you hours.
	•	A time when it got something profoundly wrong.
These small stories make the abstract real and deepen trust with readers.


## Field Exercises
At the end of each part, add one or two “field exercises” so readers can try centaur practices themselves. For example:
	•	After Thinking: “Pick a question you’re wrestling with. Write your reasoning, then ask an AI to reflect it back. What do you notice?”
	•	After Creating: “Describe an idea to an AI without asking for output. Then ask for its version. Compare.”
This turns the book from static reading into applied literacy training.


## Meta-Chapters on the Process

Because you’ve co-created this book with AI, you need at least one or two interludes that show that process. For example:
	•	On Writing With a Machine (a candid look at how the text was generated)
	•	What the Machine Saw in Me (patterns it revealed across your 1,000 days)
	•	Asking the Machine What’s Missing (this exact conversation turned into a chapter)
These chapters make the book itself an artifact of hybrid intelligence, not just a description.

Notes
- If a claim is already adequately covered by an existing mini-chapter, you can merge or reference it rather than adding a new one.
- Titles are placeholders; adjust tone to match existing chapter style.
- This list focuses on concrete actions you stated you did; general opinions or quoted actions from others were omitted.
