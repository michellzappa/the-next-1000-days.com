Missing action claims from newsletters with proposed book locations

## Tone
Your text is calm and precise, but sometimes almost too composed. Sprinkle in a few vivid moments:
	•	The first time GPT surprised you.
	•	A time when it clearly saved you hours.
	•	A time when it got something profoundly wrong.
These small stories make the abstract real and deepen trust with readers.


## Field Exercises
At the end of each part, add one or two “field exercises” so readers can try centaur practices themselves. For example:
	•	After Thinking: “Pick a question you’re wrestling with. Write your reasoning, then ask an AI to reflect it back. What do you notice?”
	•	After Creating: “Describe an idea to an AI without asking for output. Then ask for its version. Compare.”
This turns the book from static reading into applied literacy training.


## Meta-Chapters on the Process

Because you’ve co-created this book with AI, you need at least one or two interludes that show that process. For example:
	•	On Writing With a Machine (a candid look at how the text was generated)
	•	What the Machine Saw in Me (patterns it revealed across your 1,000 days)
	•	Asking the Machine What’s Missing (this exact conversation turned into a chapter)
These chapters make the book itself an artifact of hybrid intelligence, not just a description.

AI uses by chapter (consolidated)

01-thinking (Thinking)
- Newsletter: N-041
  Title: Incentive Nudge
  Draft: I explored tipping and incentive cues to steer LLM behavior. Subtle reward framing measurably improved adherence to constraints in my tests.
  
- Newsletter: N-052
  Title: Explainability Week
  Draft: I dedicated a week to interpretability papers and tools. Understanding why models answer the way they do improves trust and prompt design.
  
- Newsletter: N-098
  Title: Language Vectorization
  Draft: I asked GPT Deep Research to vectorize language change over a century and write in that projected style. Stretching models beyond summaries sharpened my sense of their limits.
  

02-creating (Creating)
- Newsletter: N-044
  Title: AI Vocabulary Build
  Draft: I compiled and fact‑checked over two hundred AI concepts with GPT’s help. Shared language accelerates thinking and collaboration.
  
- Newsletter: N-046
  Title: Weekly Covers
  Draft: I illustrate each newsletter cover with DALL‑E in minutes. Lightweight art direction keeps the publishing cadence high without sacrificing originality.
  
- Newsletter: N-042
  Title: Prompt Hours
  Draft: I spent hundreds of hours crafting DALL‑E and MidJourney prompts to rekindle visual idea capture. Iterative prompting became a creative practice, not a tool demo.
  
- Newsletter: N-073
  Title: NotebookLM Podcast
  Draft: I uploaded all newsletter intros to NotebookLM to auto‑generate a podcast. Hearing my own corpus remixed exposed recurring themes and gaps.
  
- Newsletter: N-098
  Title: 4o Image Gen
  Draft: I produced this week’s header image with OpenAI’s 4o image generation. The style transfer and coherence felt beyond what previous models allowed.
  
- Newsletter: N-021
  Title: Interview Questions
  Draft: I asked GPT to propose interview questions and iterated constraints. Letting the model draft prompts sped up preparation.
  

03-building (Building)
- Newsletter: N-026
  Title: Chunked Building
  Draft: I learned to break asks into small, verifiable chunks with ChatGPT. Modular prompts reduced errors and sped up iteration.
  
- Newsletter: N-028
  Title: Build Experiments
  Draft: I ran sustained experiments with ChatGPT as a coding partner. Rapid prototyping turned vague ideas into testable interfaces.
  
- Newsletter: N-074
  Title: Generative UX
  Draft: I prototyped interfaces that assume a generative collaborator. Design shifts from forms to conversations and affordances.
  
- Newsletter: N-086
  Title: Purpose App Prototype
  Draft: I built a mobile prototype for purpose navigation with tuned AI. Early user tests validated core loops and risks.
  
- Newsletter: N-089
  Title: Cursor + R1
  Draft: I used R1 inside Cursor to boost reasoning and planning. Stronger chain‑of‑thought improved architecture and tests.
  
- Newsletter: N-099
  Title: Co‑building Signals
  Draft: I worked with ChatGPT and Claude to prototype, code and refine Signals step by step. Multiple iterations transformed a sketch into a stable tool.
  
- Newsletter: N-100
  Title: Immersive Practice
  Draft: I spent months building, writing, and designing with AI to map possibility space. Immersion surfaced limits and leverage points.
  
- Newsletter: N-101
  Title: Signals Ensemble
  Draft: I built Signals to query multiple models in parallel and enrich results. The ensemble de‑duplicates, verifies, and turns scattered outputs into a usable briefing.
  
- Newsletter: N-104
  Title: Generative Patterns
  Draft: I explored UX patterns unique to generative models. Hand‑offs, correction loops, and uncertainty need fresh primitives.
  
- Newsletter: N-105
  Title: Ensemble Validation
  Draft: I ran identical prompts across OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, DeepSeek and Perplexity, then reconciled conflicts. Agreement raised confidence while disagreement exposed assumptions to investigate.
  
- Newsletter: N-109
  Title: Local Inference
  Draft: I ported my Purpose app from cloud Gemini to on‑device LLM on iOS 26. Local inference delivered privacy and lower costs with a working POC in Cursor.
  
- Newsletter: N-115
  Title: Claims Verification
  Draft: I implemented a GPT‑5 verification step in Signals to grade claims and cite sources. Grounded assessment lifted trust in generated research.
  
- Newsletter: N-043
  Title: Purpose Web
  Draft: I built a web experience to help people map passions and overlaps with GPT. Early feedback guided group workshop formats.
  

04-deciding (Deciding)
- Newsletter: N-114
  Title: Plural Providers
  Draft: I diversified AI providers in Signals to reduce bias and concentration risk. Orchestrating multiple models improved robustness and representativeness.
  

05-organizing (Organizing)
- Newsletter: N-111
  Title: Vibe Coding Workshop
  Draft: I co‑hosted a hands‑on AI coding workshop to build literacy and agency. Shared practice turned hesitation into momentum in a single session.
  
- Newsletter: N-078
  Title: Quick Answers Workflow
  Draft: I use Raycast’s inline chat for small questions suited to lightweight models. Keeping trivial lookups close preserves focus for deep work.
  
- Newsletter: N-077
  Title: Timeline Extraction
  Draft: I asked GPT to infer invention years for vocabulary terms and ordered entries by age. Lightweight metadata unlocked a new timeline view.
