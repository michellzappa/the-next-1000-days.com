== N-011.md ==
- This topic deeply impresses me, to the extent that I have evenwritten an essay about it._

== N-012.md ==

== N-015.md ==
- The weekly committment of sharing what I have learned about AI and developing an ongoing and public opinion about the state of development is a great reminder of how few days there _actually_ are between one Monday and the following.

== N-022.md ==
- To say I’m excited would be an understatement – London is where Envisioning effectively began a decade ago, and where I had some of my first opportunities to develop and present ideas about the emerging future of technology.
- Last week at Lisbon I learned about DreamGPT which aims to enhance the creative potential of LLMs by simulating a dreaming process, unlocking new levels of innovation and creativity in AI systems.
- I have known Inês a while and can genuinely say she was an inspiration for getting this newsletter off the ground earlier this year.

- I have linked to an interview clip in the links but highly recommend listening to the whole thing to get a sense of how the sector is shaping up.

== N-026.md ==

== N-028.md ==
- Like in previous weeks, I have been experimenting a ton, especially with ChatGPT.

== N-029.md ==

- I started this newsletter 29 weeks ago with the intent of tracking our \(inevitable\) transition toward AGI.

== N-033.md ==

== N-037.md ==
- The subject matter was “known” by the GPT because it covered topics I have written about previously, but I was surprised at how good the response came out with such little effort.

== N-039.md ==

== N-041.md ==
- > I have a strong hunch that tipping does in fact work to improve the output quality of LLMs and its conformance to constraints, but it’s very hard to prove objectively.

== N-043.md ==
- I have featured interviews by Dario Amodei in previous editions, and recommend the following links to get a sense for what it’s capable of.

== N-044.md ==
- It turns out LLMs have tremendous self-knowledge, so I have been leveraging lots of GPT to develop and fact-check **over 200 AI-related concepts and terms**.

== N-045.md ==
- This very newsletter attempts to sense-make in small increments, but I have a lingering feeling that something greater is necessary.
- Recorded almost a year ago, it is incredibly prescient.

== N-046.md ==
- I have been thinking a lot about working and hiring in a context where autonomous systems are already capable of replacing so many of our tasks.

== N-049.md ==
- After a year covering the cutting edge of AI, I have cemented my opinion that the general-purpose nature of AI applications mean that no industry or sector of modern economies will remain unaffected.

== N-051.md ==
- Article mentions he uses Lex, which I have experimented with but never gotten used to.

== N-052.md ==
- I have little commentary to add, as this past week has been all about _explainability_ for me.
- When the newsletter began last year, each issue featured an _emerging vocabulary_ , or term/concept that I had learned about and which carries a particular meaning in AI.

== N-058.md ==
- In contrast, I have tried to remain focused on concentrated efforts.
- Presented at a fast pace and without exercises, it runs about 90 min.

== N-059.md ==
- Having spent the weekend moving house here in Amsterdam, I have very little in terms of personal commentary this week – only that 1\) forcefully stepping away from screens can be a relief 2\) good housing in a dense city is a tremendous privilege and 3\) extending my abilities with AI has become second nature and it would feel like a cognitive downgrade losing access to it.

== N-063.md ==
- Below is a full day’s worth of listening from the people actually building AI – I hope you enjoy it as much as I did\!

== N-067.md ==
- Greetings from a humid and busy Bangkok where I have the privilege to talk about centaurs and our trajectory towards AGI for an audience of curious leaders.

== N-071.md ==

== N-075.md ==
- I had the privilege of joining a conference which brought together people from as many such fields as possible.
- Despite being deeply into science-fiction visions of the future, and having followed emerging technology professionally nearly two decades, I had my questions.

- I have been experimenting with collecting different quantitative aspects of each vocab term in order to look for groupings or clusters.

== N-079.md ==

== N-082.md ==
- Despite my past inability, in the past year I have conceptualized and launched a different coding project each month.
- In doing this, I have noticed a couple of foundational skills which might help you strengthen your own abilities in building everything you can imagine.

== N-092.md ==
- I have noticed a significant uptick in people _vibe coding_ on Twitter and Reddit, and it’s easy to understand why.

== N-093.md ==
