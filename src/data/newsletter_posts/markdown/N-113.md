Welcome to your regular dispatch of probable futures.

Last week’s essay on the _[AI Line](https://newsletter.envisioning.io/p/the-ai-line-112) asked how we should measure ourselves against ever-smarter “advanced autocompletes.” Most discussion dwells on what we stand to lose—skills left unused, agency surrendered.

I disagree.

Automation expands, not shrinks, our capacity.

I still reserve a few tasks for the joy of doing them by hand, but most of my workload would benefit from machine assistance.

Software development (or _vibe coding_ ) proves the point.

I’ve [shown](https://newsletter.envisioning.io/p/we-turned-sand-into-thinking-machines) [before](https://newsletter.envisioning.io/p/futures-collapse-105) how writing web and mobile apps multiplies leverage, especially for founders. Nearly everyone I meet wants to sharpen their coding skills and delegate the routine.

There’s no universal curriculum. Developers learn in as many ways as there are developers. Two formats consistently work:

* **Hackathons:** immersive, in-person sprints that push newcomers to ship something real (which you can [read more about](https://newsletter.envisioning.io/p/failure-of-imagination-111)).

* **Coding clubs:** recurring online sessions where members demo projects, trade feedback, and help beginners start building.

If that sounds interesting to you,

and I are hosting an _online coding club_ in a few weeks on **[7 August](https://lu.ma/agg0ehir)**. Join us\!

We have also have an upcoming _Vibe Coding Workshop on AI, Creativity and Esotericism_ in Amsterdam on **[7 October](https://lu.ma/1v8jsbla)**.

Until next week,
MZ
