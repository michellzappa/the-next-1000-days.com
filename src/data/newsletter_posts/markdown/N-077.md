# 077

Happy Monday and welcome to your weekly download of AI opinions, news and memes.

I am short on personal commentary this week but think you might enjoy these new-to-me ways of using AI throughout the day:

**Ask quick questions from my computer** using [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com). The desktop ChatGPT app also features a keyboard triggered chatbar, but I find Raycast fast and seamless for most simple queries.

Ask Claude or ChatGPT to **create scripts** for every kind of data operation I can think of, like merging or organzing structured data files. Maybe you don’t spend as much time as I do manipulating data, but the application is general. Scripts, particularly in Python, are a powerful way of managing information.

Using ChatGPT’s advanced voice mode to help me **practice Dutch** \(or almost any language\). Duolingo only goes so far, so instead of bothering locals with my poor Dutch, I can spend a couple of minutes daily with an infinitely patient language coach who both corrects me and gives me some confidence to actually speak to strangers.

Asking **Claude** to generate interactive explainers from our [AI Vocab](https://www.envisioning.io/vocab/) to help more people understand the underlying concepts. Claude is pretty good at creating web components, especially through dialogue, which can be used to illustrate many, maybe all Vocab terms.

I hope this triggers insights into how to use similar tools yourself\!

Until next week,
MZ

#### Unintended Consequences of AI's Evolution \(20 min\)

Technical talk about the implications of generative UX, which touches on some of my favorite topics: Centaurs and unintended consequences of technology.

> . _..good Sci-Fi predicts cars, great sci-fi predicts traffic._

* * *

#### GitHub Spark Showcase \(1 min\)

GitHub stepping up the game. Good time to be a coder.

* * *

#### Physical AI \(3 min\)

Hype-ish but technically accurate video by NVidia about robotics, which they call physical AI, and how they are enabling it.

* * *

#### Two Possible Futures \(30 min\)

If, like myself, you have been meaning to read [Dario Amodei](https://darioamodei.com/machines-of-loving-grace) and [Sam Altman's](https://ia.samaltman.com) recent essays but haven't found the time yet, here is an excellent \(human\) podcast discussing their takes and differences \(the first 30 min or so\).

Here is a NotebookLM version of the same comparison of both essays with minimal instructions.

#### Planning in AI \(1h\)

How we reach generality: OpenAI research scientist Noam Brown on planning & search in AI. Dense and technical and fascinating.

> _Just by adding search, we were able to do the equivalent of scaling the models by 100,000×_

* * *

#### The Leap to 10 Trillion Parameters \(30 min\)

Feed the hype. Great conversation from YC.

> _...if we make the models smart enough that they can actually do original thinking and deep analysis with correct logic... maybe we'll finally invent it all._

#### Envisioning Vocab

Don’t miss the generative knowledge graph of [our AI terms](https://www.envisioning.io/vocab/). Very experimental but fully functional. A navigable graph of all \(800+\) vocab terms where connections are made based on the similarity between nodes, creating a sort of map of all AI related concepts out there. Don’t miss it: [envisioning.io/vocab/map/](https://www.envisioning.io/vocab/map/)

We are also experimenting with a timeline view in the shape of a sunflower. I asked GPT to determine the year of invention for each of the terms, and have used this data to order the entries by age. Check it out: [envisioning.io/vocab/timeline/](https://www.envisioning.io/vocab/timeline/)

We are thinking of applying this methodology to other technical fields. LMK if you have suggestions.
