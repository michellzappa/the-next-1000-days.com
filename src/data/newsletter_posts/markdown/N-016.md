# 016

_Double Issue._ Every week I usually feature five links to articles and videos that have sparked my interest around artificial intelligence and our slow, certain transition toward AGI. This week features twice the links in order to 1\) reduce my publication backlog and 2\) keep you all extra-busy reading and learning about important aspects about our developing relationship to autonomous systems.

Judging from Substack stats, most of you don‚Äôt click through the links ‚Äì which tells me my commentary and insight is valued more than the linked content itself. With that in mind, I have tried describing the material and value of each post with a bit more care this week. Hope this makes sense to you and helps brighten your week a little bit.

##### Emerging Vocabulary

### Adversarial Instructions

_The guidance or input provided to a system, typically with the intention to confuse, mislead, or exploit it in some way. While the term can be applied generally across various systems, it's frequently discussed in the context of machine learning models and AI systems. Adversarial instructions might involve phrasing questions or inputs in deceptive ways, trying to trick the model into giving incorrect or unintended responses. \(AKA Jailbreaking\)_
