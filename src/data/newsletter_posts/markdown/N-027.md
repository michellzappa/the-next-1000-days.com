# 027

Happy Monday and welcome to another edition of Artificial Insights, where we explore as many different perspectives about the emerging field of AI as possible. As 2023 starts drawing to a close we may ask ourselves what to expect from the year ahead. This has been a year of \(dare I say\) unprecedented change when it comes to practical applications of machine learning, and 2024 will be even more so.

I am sure you are also experiencing AI fatigue. The news can be overwhelming, and the conversations about its manifold implications can feel draining. I am not here to fan the flames. Rather I think we should spend more time experimenting with it. The only race worth mentioning is the one towards greater, better use of these tools. Depending on your use, they can be borderline magical.

There is no doubt whether you are going to see more AI in the months and years ahead - I think that’s a certainty. The only question worth asking is what role you want to play in this transition.

PS. I’m in Amsterdam this week for THNK and Lisbon next for WebSummit. DM if you’re around and up for coffee.

#### **Residual-Aided Intermediate Fusion \(** RAIF\)

An architecture in deep learning focused on multi-modal aesthetic recognition. It employs a strategy that combines feature representations from different stages of a neural network, utilizing both intermediate fusion and residual skip connections to enhance recognition performance. Can be used for multi-modal aesthetic recognition and multimodal matching of vision and language.
