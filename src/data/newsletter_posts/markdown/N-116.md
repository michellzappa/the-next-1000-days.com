Welcome back to Artificial Insights, your weekly dispatch from the near future.

The [Ember months](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ember_months) are here, and I expect the next stretch to bring an overwhelming mix of AI breakthroughs, hype, and inevitable disappointments.

What feels most valuable right now are the jagged edges, where customization makes all the difference. GPT-5 is remarkable, but its expanded ability to keep more of my chat history in context is what truly transforms it into a reliable partner. Programming in Cursor with code scaffolds is far more productive than tossing vague prompts into the void. Generating images with style references in MidJourney is far more effective than leaving the model to guess aesthetics.

[LLMs](https://www.envisioning.io/vocab/llm-large-language-model) explore latent space indiscriminately; you gain leverage by constraining them with context.

One striking use of larger context windows has been in personal health. While traveling, a food-triggered toothache dragged on for a week. With no local dentist available, GPT-5 helped me track evolving symptoms, offering a coherent, likely diagnosis that a later dentist visit confirmed. Previous models would have struggled to connect the dots.

For consumer AI, customization will become the stickiest issue. Why switch to another model if doing so means erasing your accumulated context? I don’t think people will.

…

In the coming months we’ll return to weekly newsletter issues alongside a mix of in-person and remote events.

* **Vibe Coding (Amsterdam, Oct 7):** I’m co-hosting the third edition of our vibe coding hackathon at the [Embassy of the Free Mind](https://embassyofthefreemind.com/) during [World AI Week](https://worldaiweek.ai). The last two sessions sold out quickly, so reserve your spot now on [Luma](https://luma.com/1v8jsbla).

* **Envisioning Signals (Sep 11):** Join us for a live demo of [Signals](https://signals.envisioning.io/), our generative foresight tool. We’ll show how multiple AI models combine to surface signals of change for innovation teams, and participants will receive a free custom scan. Tickets available on [Luma](https://luma.com/6zmr35jy).

Until next week,
MZ

#### The Cracks in the AI Boom (15min)

[Use AI where it clearly saves time and money](https://youtu.be/153Y_LP2oYc), but keep your core identity, voice, and relationships human.

* * *

**Automating Coding Through AI Models (28 min)**

Michael Truell points to a dramatic but gradual shift: [coding won’t disappear, but it will increasingly resemble collaboration with an intelligent partner](https://youtu.be/TrXi3naD6Og).

> _There will be this long messy middle where you will be working with the AI more and more… like a colleague more and more._

#### Difference, Creativity, and Why LLMs ≠ AGI (58 min)

[David Deutsch offers a grounded counter to AI hype](https://youtu.be/IVA2bK9qjzE): expect faster work and better tools, but don’t mistake them for human-origin explanatory creativity—or for a shortcut to mass-produced genius.

> _For AI, yes… the rate of progress… will be greatly increased… But AGI… I don't see any reason why having AGIs around is any better than having humans around._

#### Between Hype and History (1h15 min)

[Benedict Evans frames AI as a major platform shift](https://youtu.be/2NgdQf2GzJg) whose contours are uncertain, but whose competitive and behavioral resets are all but inevitable. Thanks Rod\!

> _It seems to me right now you could do like a double blind test of the same prompt given to Grock, Claude, Gemini, Mistral, Deep Seek. I bet most people wouldn't be able to tell which is which._
