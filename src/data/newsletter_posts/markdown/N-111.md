Happy Monday and welcome back to your regular delivery of AI memes, links and commentary.

Had you asked me a few years ago how I’d be spending time with AI, software development wouldn’t have made the list. Yet today it’s my primary focus—not just coding, but helping others unlock their own sense of agency when it comes to telling machines what to do.

Last Friday in Amsterdam, I co-hosted a workshop with

at the Embassy of the Free Mind with 50 curious minds exploring the intersection of AI, creativity, and esotericism. Each participant brought a personal project, and we helped them build the mindset and toolkit to bring their visions to life. In just a few hours, we witnessed uncertainty dissolve into possibility.

Projects ranged from the occult to the practical—from designing spiritual travel guides to translating sound into cymatic visuals. For many, the mystery of software gave way to a new kind of literacy. With an infinitely patient sidekick at our fingertips, coding felt less like a foreign language and more like a native tongue.

Personally, I’ve found more creative agency than I ever imagined—and I saw the same spark light up in the room. What we call “vibe coding” now feels like a medium, and to my surprise, it resonates deeply with creatives.

We’ll be doing more of these. In person and online. Stay tuned.

Until next week,
MZ

> in the beginning photography and film, the magic of it drew people in. then it connects to ai. it talks about the technologies but mostly the incentives behind it and the business model of it all.
