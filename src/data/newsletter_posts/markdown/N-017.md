Happy end-of-August to us all.

If you were an AGI ‚Äì an unlimited intelligence capable of solving any problem or discovering anything ‚Äì what would you learn from humanity? If you were capable of complete omniscience, what would you gain from interacting with us?

We have not directly experienced any such intelligence, though some would argue we are currently developing something like superintelligence or AGI. Myriad definitions of what a ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù intelligence would entail, but most seem to agree that an autonomous agent capable of optimizing for its own growth is unlikely to align with the interests of humanity at large. Especially when considering the interests of private organizations and nation states working to achieve AGI first.

Such an intelligence might be difficult to imagine, but it‚Äôs important we do. Neither of us are individually responsible for developing such technologies ‚Äì but technology does not exist in a vacum, and our collective actions determine the futures we end up experiencing.

This week‚Äôs edition again tries to capture the spirit of such change, while inviting us to think about the _kinds_ of intelligence we want to interact with.

#### [How Will We Know When AI is Conscious?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQjPKqE39No) üß†

The video tackles AI consciousness, touching on the limitations of existing language models like ChatGPT. It questions if these systems are truly intelligent or just emulating human-like responses, noting potential risks like misinformation and emotional manipulation. We need a scientific understanding of consciousness before fully deploying advanced AI systems.

* **AI Consciousness** : The video sparks intrigue by delving into the philosophical question of when, or if, AI can become conscious.

* **Emotional Risks** : It brings a cautionary note to becoming emotionally attached to AI systems, which might manipulate human feelings.

* **Misuse** : The discussion points out risks in wielding AI that can convincingly mimic human intellect, such as spreading misinformation or manipulating public opinion.

#### [Decoding AGI: Eugenics, Transhumanism, and Bias](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7XT4TWLzJw) üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è

Timnit Gebru explores the intersections of Eugenics and Transhumanism in AGI development. She warns against AGI perpetuating societal biases and advocates for a focus on preventing harm. Gebru's work in deep learning and her project '[Gender Shades](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v81/buolamwini18a/buolamwini18a.pdf)' demonstrate her commitment to responsible AI.

* **Historical Context** : Connects the development of AGI with historical ideologies like Eugenics and Transhumanism, offering a nuanced understanding.

* **Bias and Inequality** : Spotlights the risks of perpetuating societal biases and inequalities through AGI, adding an ethical layer to the discussion.

* **Preventing Harm** : Calls for a shift in focus from just developing AGI to also preventing harm, underscoring the importance of ethical considerations.

##### Emerging Vocabulary

### Parameters

_The internal variables that the model learns during the training process. These variables form the core of the model, allowing the learning algorithm to make accurate predictions by adjusting the relationship between features and the target variable. Depending upon the algorithm, an AI model can have one or more parameters. For instance, in a deep learning neural network, the weights and biases learned during training are considered the parameters of the models._
