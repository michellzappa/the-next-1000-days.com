One of the reasons I decided to publish Artificial Insights was always having an excuse to experiment with automation myself. Like most people spending significant time on their computers, over the years I have toyed with scripts, macros and code to help facilitate workflows or simply for the sake of learning.

Some readers ask me if the newsletter is written by an AI ‚Äì and while it still isn‚Äôt ‚Äì it makes sense to create a personal workflow optimizing for what I want to spend more \(or less\) time on. Writing is a form of learning, so I‚Äôm not interested in ceding this regular opportunity for synthesis to automation ‚Äì at least not entirely. Having explored a few of approaches for speeding up my workflow, I‚Äôm now using Zapier to turn YouTube links using Raindrop into summarized descriptions with links in a Google Doc, and another for arbitrary links to articles. This enables tagging a link on any platform for review and editing, which helps me spend more watching and learning and less time juggling links.

This issue covers the usual array of memes, perspectives and explainers around AI with an eye towards AGI. If this resonates or if you have profiles or links to share, please always reach out.

#### **[Humans With AI Will Replace Humans Without AI](https://hbr.org/2023/08/ai-wont-replace-humans-but-humans-with-ai-will-replace-humans-without-ai) ‚úÖ**

AI is set to drastically reduce cognition costs, akin to how the internet diminished information transmission costs, according to Harvard Business School professor Karim Lakhani, an authority on workplace technology and AI. Mastering AI and machine learning is not just essential for tech-savvy employees but is crucial for all staff in a company.

##### Emerging Vocabulary

### Token

_The smallest unit of data that represents a particular piece of information and how text or speech is broken down into tokens for further analysis. These tokens can be individual words, phrases, or even characters, depending on the specific task at hand. Tokenization converts unstructured data, such as text or speech, into a structured format that can be easily processed by AI models. By breaking down text into tokens, AI systems can efficiently analyze language patterns, identify the meaning of words based on their context, and perform various tasks like sentiment analysis, text classification, named entity recognition, and machine translation._
