Happy Monday and welcome to your regular download of ambitious investigations.

There are weeks where decades happen. AI is happening on so many fronts, by so many people, that staying abreast of where to even pay attention, is an incredible challenge. Thankfully for you, I spend my days glued to the internet filtering and selecting the bits and bobs that help you stay ahead.

Good news, everyone\! We are rolling out a new visual identity for the newsletter, and recently upgraded our WhatsApp group to a community with dedicated channels for regional meetups.

This newsletter now features ‚ÄúAI turquoise‚Äù \([1](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/turquoise-taillights-tell-you-this-mercedes-is-driving-autonomously/), [2](https://boingboing.net/2024/06/20/logitech-mouse-has-a-dedicated-ai-button.html)\) which might or might now become a _thing_ , but it also helps us separate the newsletter from the [optic yellow](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=%22optic+yellow%22+tennis+ball&t=osx&ia=web) used by Envisioning.

The upgraded WhatsApp community hopes to be an upgrade to the already-wonderful experience we are having in the group. We now have separate meetup groups for members in Amsterdam and Brazil, and hope to roll out a few select dedicated channels for issues which don‚Äôt overlap with the primary chat channel.

I‚Äôll be in Bangkok in a couple of weeks presenting the previously discussed AI Masterclass the [Global Trend Summit](https://www.zipeventapp.com/e/GLOBAL-TREND-SUMMIT-BANGKOK-Aug2024). Ping me if you‚Äôre around\!

Until next week,
MZ

#### Advanced Prompting Techniques \(17 min\)

[Mckay Wrigley on X offers a breakdown](https://x.com/mckaywrigley/status/1821307469114769903) of advanced prompting techniques for LLMs. I especially like the custom tooling for resolving issues with a step by step approach \(prompt chaining\). I also like how they plan around the role of humans in the loop, with specific inputs and observation models.

#### Advanced Approaches for Code

In the same vein, here is an advanced Coding System Prompt \([Roah Paul on X](https://x.com/rohanpaul_ai/status/1822154712583487826) and [/r/PromptEngineering on Reddit](https://t.co/dZiiURXhOc)\) which is apparently helping people produce better output with code. In my experience, Claude 3.5 is already a lot better than GPT 4 at such tasks.

#### What if OpenAI vanishes tomorrow? \(50 min\)

[High-signal podcast with YC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSUviaN1eso) group partners and the creator of Gmail - Paul Buchhet on‚Ä¶ AI. Highly recommended and difficult to summarize. They cover a lot of ground with great technical and commercial insight.

#### What‚Äôs Next from Anthropic \(15 min\)

[Very timely presentation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuC1GWhQdKE) by the head of developer relations at Anthropic, Alex Albert. Technical and detailed and supports the idea that we are nowhere near a slowdown.

#### Where Facebook‚Äôs AI Slop Comes From

[Amazing deep dive by Jason Koebler in 404 Media](https://www.404media.co/where-facebooks-ai-slop-comes-from/) on the financial motives for creating online content. This isn‚Äôt going away.

> Facebook itself is paying creators in India, Vietnam, and the Philippines for bizarre AI spam that they are learning to make from YouTube influencers and guides sold on Telegram.

#### Bratpropagation

#### Diffusion Models are having a moment.

[FLUX.1](https://flux1ai.com) from the StableDiffusion team is _something else_. [You should play around with it](https://flux1ai.com/create). [Don‚Äôt miss Ethan Mollick‚Äôs take](https://x.com/emollick/status/1822774265390985401) ü¶¶üí∫.

#### Big week for robots

[Figure announced their 02 Model](https://x.com/Figure_robot/status/1820791819023909031) on X. Better hands and movement coupled with speech-to-speech and lots of other improvements means we are one step closer to humanoid robots at work and home.
