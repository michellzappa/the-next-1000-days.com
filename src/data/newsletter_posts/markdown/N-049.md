Happy Monday and welcome to your weekly guide to the near future.

Something that keeps coming up when talking about how to upskill people by teaching them strategic AI applications is usually the question of technical preparedness. Who do you write for? What do you expect in terms of prior knowledge?

Maybe you have just heard of ChatGPT, or perhaps youâ€™re already fine-tuning Llama-3 on your local GPU cluster â€“ no matter. This newsletter is written for _everyone_ interested in the subject.

After a year covering the cutting edge of AI, I have cemented my opinion that the general-purpose nature of AI applications mean that no industry or sector of modern economies will remain unaffected. Maybe we will have to calibrate expectations down moving forward, or maybe we havenâ€™t even started scratching the surface. It is difficult to estimate how quickly it will affect particular groups or functions, but it is certain that weâ€™ll keep ratcheting up both our dependence and the utility of these tools.

This week I have more questions than answers and hope the selection of links and videos below will satiate your curiosity. Iâ€™m also working on a new presentation deck and narrative where I hope to organize current thoughts about the machine-augmented transformation we are all experiencing. Will share more with you in the coming weeks.

Until next time,
MZ

#### Adapting to AI: Transforming Customer Service

This is a pretty great reflection about customer service after AI. [Des Traynor, co-founder of Intercom](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiWV0T0qbeY), talks about our expectations and experience when interfacing with AI agents.

> _You cantâ€™t fall in love with the solution to a problem. You have to be in love with the problem you're trying to solve because the technology will come and go. There'll be a better way always to do these things and it'll come along every 10, 20, 30 years._
