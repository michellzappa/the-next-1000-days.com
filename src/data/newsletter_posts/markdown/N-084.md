Happy Holidays and welcome to your weekly gift wrapped insights about the collective revolution we are experiencing.

This week is light on personal commentary and heavy on curated links to help you make sense of the news. I am spending most of my holiday downtime coding. Of all things I could be doing \(with or without AI\), programming feels like the highest-impact activity of all. Both in terms of learning & enjoyment as well as the potential of these creations out the wild.

The AI news cycle is incessant, so I expect we’ll keep seeing interesting releases during the otherwise slow months of northern winter. OpenAI finished their 12 days of shipmas last Friday with O3, their new state-of-the-art, chain-of-thought model. O3 scores remarkably high on the ARC-AGI challenge, which means it has a high general intelligence quotient, albeit at a tremendous financial cost of upwards to thousands of dollars per run.

It’s interesting how a spectrum of potential price points emerge, where certain solutions are extremely time-sensitive whereas others can take an arbitrary amount of time \(and money\), as long as they eventually get the answer right.

Wishing you quiet days,

Michell

#### Everything you need to understand O3

Simulated reasoning on the rise.

> According to OpenAI, the o3 model earned a record-breaking score on the [ARC-AGI](https://arcprize.org/arc)benchmark, a visual reasoning benchmark that has gone unbeaten since its creation in 2019. In low-compute scenarios, o3 scored 75.7 percent, while in high-compute testing, it reached 87.5 percent—comparable to human performance at an 85 percent threshold.

> During the livestream, the president of the ARC Prize Foundation said, "When I see these results, I need to switch my worldview about what AI can do and what it is capable of."
