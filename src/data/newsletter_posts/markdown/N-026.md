I don’t know about you, but I spent my weekend developing an interactive web app from scratch. It’s worth mentioning that I don’t code. I tried learning assorted languages over the years but something about _writing_ the code never clicked, so in practical terms I’m always left negotiating with developers rather than just building what I want. All of this changed after lunch on Saturday when I decided to implement something I’ve always wanted to build – an AI-based Tarot reading app – as an actual, working, webpage.

It is nothing short of mindblowing what it _feels_ like to build with ChatGPT. Transformative doesn’t really begin to describe what it’s like to have a limitless assistant helping you do _anything_.

You have to be mindful of the size of chunks you are asking GPT to build. I made the mistake of starting with an ambitious request, and quickly realized the confident-but-wrong approach ChatGPT is known for also applies to code.

After a while you start getting the hang of how what is work asking, and how to build complexity in modules. Chunking your requests becomes second nature and you quickly realize Chat can be used to answer any question. Something isn’t working? Short of ideas of what to do next? Copywriting? Images? Troubleshooting? ChatGPT has your back.

The app is fully functional but isn’t quite ready to share, and it’s hard to convey how profound this shift feels to me. You no longer need anyone to help you do any of these things anymore. To me that meant spending the weekend intensly coding and making something work.

I have no idea how you will spend your time differently moving forward, but strongly advice investing $20 on ChatGPT Plus and investing as much attention as possible wrangling these tools to start understanding what remains.

##### Emerging Vocabulary

#### **Generalization**

_Refers to an algorithm's ability to apply learned information from specific training instances to new, unseen examples. It's a fundamental concept in machine learning where the primary goal of any model is to achieve high predictive performance on new, unseen datasets, and not just on the data it has been trained on. Good generalization means that the model has really learned the underlying patterns in the training data and can accurately predict for unseen data, rather than just memorizing specific instances._
