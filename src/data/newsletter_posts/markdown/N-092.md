Welcome to your weekly immersion into the cutting edge of AI.

The first month and a half of my year has been characterized by spending plenty of time coding – hacking away at ways of solving my own problems. I have noticed a significant uptick in people _vibe coding_ on Twitter and Reddit, and it’s easy to understand why. Building apps, to me, has become the single most leveraged activity I can think of. Knowing what can be built, and how easy it can be, is mind-bending and irreversible.

For those wanting to dive deeper into AI coding, I've recently created a dedicated group in our WhatsApp community aptly named [Coding Club](https://chat.whatsapp.com/GB5x6X6U7dDGGE6I5whbGx). Join us to learn more and share what you’re working on. I am also hosting a first [AI Coding Club meetup](https://lu.ma/5nd6vvzz) later this week on Zoom for those wanting to strengthen their skills and discuss specifics. Would love to see you there.

Finally, the WhatsApp group now has a [Foresight Exchange](https://chat.whatsapp.com/BmVZQTwmiO1APGZuvYRMfB), a space for innovation experts everywhere to trade ideas and research. We are actively building tools in this space - especially around generative approaches to research - so make sure you’re in the group to try our new tools soon.

Until next week,
MZ

> Today, usage is concentrated in software development and technical writing tasks. Over one-third of occupations \(roughly 36%\) see AI use in at least a quarter of their associated tasks, while approximately 4% of occupations use it across three-quarters of their associated tasks.

#### Acts Not Facts \(35 min\)

Brilliant presentation by the [always interesting Matt Webb](https://youtu.be/vDP24ARdGDA) from last year's TH/NGS here in Amsterdam, all about agents and building apps with AI. Great mix of hands-on experience with big picture thinking. With our very own Monique van Dusseldorp hosting the session.

> _Matt is always super interesting indeed - his newsletter is always full of new thoughts and ideas. Here the last one, on ''[Extending AI chat with Model Context Protocol \(and why it matters\)](https://interconnected.org/home/2025/02/11/mcp#archive)'' - which may interest some of you._

#### Future Agents \(30 min\)

Spectacular [Q&A from the WSJ with Bret Taylor](https://youtu.be/lOnyZcePTBI), chairman at OpenAI. They focus on agents but cover much of the buzz that's on the agenda: Musk, China, etc.

> In 2025, I think every company will have an AI agent with its brand at the top—just like having a website in 1995 or a mobile app a decade ago.

#### Building Effective AI Agents \(20 min\)

[Great continuation video from Anthropic](https://youtu.be/LP5OCa20Zpg) for their [Building Effective Agents](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents) blog post a few weeks ago.

> An agent is where you’re letting the LLM decide how many times to run—continuing to loop until it finds a resolution.

Language models are obviously not good at math, but here is an interesting representation of exactly how good or bad they are at multiplication.
