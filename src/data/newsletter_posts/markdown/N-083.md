Happy Monday, and welcome to the countdown for an exciting 2025.

Two years ago, we shared the collective epiphany of realizing _AI is here._

After playing with ChatGPT and GPT 3.5 a couple of minutes, most of us realized that this is _different_ and that something immensely transformative is about to happen.

As we turn the page on 2024 and reflect on where we are, I suspect many of us feel overwhelmed and barely keeping up with the present â€“ and there is little spare bandwidth to consider how tomorrow might be different. Others see opportunity in the transition and accept the feeling of overwhelm instead of rejecting it. Perhaps by ignoring it, or maybe like treating it as background noise.

How do we maximize the likelihood of collective success in such a transition? What are the means of balancing its negative implications and externalities with its inevitable upsides? How do we not shoot ourselves in the foot with AI, but rather leverage it toward personal and interpersonal growth in every sense of the word?

I suspect quite a few holiday conversations with family will revolve around AI and where itâ€™s going next â€“ so you, their resident expert, will have the opportunity to illuminate them, hear their concerns and work with their fears. If AI is indeed coming for us all, then it is our responsibility to guide its reception.

Until next week,
MZ

#### Insightful panel from NYT DealBook Summit \(90 min\)

Do yourself a favor and [listen to what this panel of experts](https://youtu.be/AhiYRseTAVw) thinks is happening in AI and whatâ€™s next. It is pointless to try to summarize it, because everyone will have different _aha_ -moments from listening to this frankly awesome session. The lightning round in the end is especially endearing. Bonus points if you spot this issueâ€™s title and its meaning.

#### Pre-training as we know it will end

[Big claims by Ilya](https://youtu.be/1yvBqasHLZs). Apparently pre-training is "done" and what comes next is superintelligence, in surprisingly little detail. Should have been an hour, not 15 min. My impression: as a legitimate researcher, Ilya has little reason to create hype. Maybe Iâ€™m being naive.
