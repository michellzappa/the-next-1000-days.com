Happy Monday and welcome to your weekly satellite picture of where the _AI ecosystem_ seems to be heading.

I usually watch every video shared here \(especially the longer ones\) but I have spent less time learning and more time building recently. When _vibe coding_ , I find it impossible to pay attention to people talking in the background, meaning I haven’t actually spent a lot of time absorbing this week’s video selection - instead I am sharing what stood out from my YouTube algorithm and the usual assortment of insights from our amazing WhatsApp community.

Last week saw the first meetup of our new **AI Coding Club**. I’m excited about the amount of interest in the group. We had largely two groups of participants: newbies looking to understand what is even possible, and developers with an eye for new techniques and approaches for collaborating with AI beyond code completion. Instead of splitting groups yet, I thought of running a few more _mixed-group sessions_ first. The next ones are happening this 🎟️ [Thursday Feb 27](https://lu.ma/ozk8a84b) at 11:00 \(CET\) and the next one on 🎟️ [Thursday Mar 6](https://lu.ma/2od0hbz0) at 19:00 \(CET\).

Our first session sold out, and I want to keep the sessions small to make sure everyone has an opportunity to level up their skills. The upcoming sessions will focus on _building an app together from scratch_. There are many ways of developing software, and I want to show how radically different of an approach AI unlocks. Would love to see you there\!

We are also organizing a couple of in-person sessions to meet fellow community members and strengthening our collective AI skills. The last few in-person sessions focused on AGI & ASI, while the upcoming ones will probably lean more toward AI Coding - and how it might be accelerating our transition toward superintelligence.
