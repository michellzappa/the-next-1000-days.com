Everything is political.

As someone steeped in U.S. culture thanks to growing up on a diet of video games, rock music, and the early Internet, I feel at least partially connected to the “American way.” Having never lived in the U.S., my experience and observations are strictly those of a curious outsider, now watching what happens when the inmates run the asylum.

History books teach us the perils of totalitarianism, but if your world knowledge is insular, the necessary context to perceive the systematic institutional dismantling taking place will seem, like everything else American, exceptional.

Technology is adjacent to politics, and it is unclear to me how politics actually shapes it.

Each government applies its best minds to controlling its technological future, but because technology changes so quickly, there are no playbooks – only best guesses and market dynamics.

The U.S. AI industry is arguably more beholden to capital than policy, but I wonder how long that will last. The bull in the china shop will eventually stumble out, but the dismantling and repurposing of political power seems unlikely to be reversed. More plausibly, the U.S. status quo will normalize into a more politicized environment, riddled with visible and invisible biases, just to keep operating.

How this affects the rest of the world is impossible to anticipate. Resistance grows under pressure. Alternatives to hegemonic technology might proliferate. U.S. industry and expertise might expand outward differently – not with blind assumptions, but humbled into positions where leverage is exerted differently.

I remain optimistic about our future with AI.

Despite the turmoil, I’ve noticed how apolitical and international the average ML engineer tends to be. Leaders will have no shortage of regulations to navigate, but the talent needed to build seemingly carries little ideology. The engineers, researchers, and users form a diffuse, transnational counterweight to centralized power.

The open question is whether that will be strong enough to resist capture – or whether, as history suggests, resistance itself will become the driving force of innovation.

Until next week,
MZ

#### Context Beats Prompts in AI (14 min)

Tiago Forte (Founder of Forte Labs) [argues that the real power of AI](https://youtu.be/ipIOC55AwyQ) isn’t in bigger models or clever prompts. It’s in context: system instructions, personal preferences, and project knowledge that turn AI into a true team member.
