Happy Monday and welcome to your regular dispatch of AI news.

Sometimes it’s best to appreciate the silence.

Until next time,

#### Kevin Scott on AI Evolution

Excellent interview with Kevin Scott, Microsoft’s CTO and arguably the person who placed their bet on OpenAI. Worth a listen. Detailed, not too technical and very forward-looking. Kevin seems like a firm believer that current technical model limitations will be resolved in little time \(and you can be pretty sure he’s tested GPT-5 and beyond.\)

> _Humanoid robots are closer to being a real part of our workforce than you might think._

I copied the above video transcript and asked Claude 3.5 to create a graph to visualize the performance gain in NVidia GPUs that Kevin Scott mentions. [With a bit of back-and-forth we produced this](https://claude.site/artifacts/289eb831-eb85-488f-b3db-ea0277ed8aaf).

#### Solomonoff Splines

If you watch Kevin Scott’s interview to the end, you’ll appreciate this one-liner from AppleTV’s new killer-robot-drama _Sunny_.

Super interesting approach for developing with LLMs: [A micro-agentic framework](https://github.com/BuilderIO/micro-agent), which validates its own code creation and iterates until it works.

#### The Rise of Humanoid Robots

My YouTube feed is 50% AI content, some of which is pretty interesting, [like this reportage on robotics](https://youtu.be/v0uKLCZocjs) \(the ultimate agent\!\).

> _Generative AI is really a key unlock overall for what you can get a robot to do, let alone a humanoid robot. Robotics is where AI meets reality._

[MIT Tech Review just published a definitive guide to "What is AI"](https://www.technologyreview.com/2024/07/10/1094475/what-is-artificial-intelligence-ai-definitive-guide/), which I look forward to reading a condensed version of.

[Nice interview with Lee Sedol, the world's top Go player](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/10/world/asia/lee-saedol-go-ai.html) who in 2016 famously lost to DeepMind's AlphaGo. He ended up dropping out of the game \(or competitive play\) because of how much his world view was shattered from the loss.

> “ _Losing to A.I., in a sense, meant my entire world was collapsing._ ”

Similar to how robots are created to navigate the human built environment, maybe AI agents will need to navigate our software and other interfaces. [Here's an interesting approach for GCC: General Computer Control](https://baai-agents.github.io/Cradle/)
