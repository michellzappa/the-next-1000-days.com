Happy Monday and welcome to your weekly dose of generative opinions.

Last week’s keynote session was a blast, and I am convinced there is demand for deeper insight and discussion about the collective transition we are experiencing everywhere. Pointing our attention toward the technological revolution afforded by AI has become a universal meme, and arguably no organizations which will be unaffected by this.

One surprising takeaway was learning how most people are actively interacting with AI on a daily or weekly basis. I am certain this would not have been the case a year ago.

I will soon share a recorded version of the keynote with you all. The content offers a deep dive into the key areas that in my opinion will help you develop a strong understanding of where AI is taking us, and I can’t wait to share it with everyone.

If you already haven’t, consider joining [our incredible WhatsApp community](https://chat.whatsapp.com/BM4B2xI1ZkULA5we3Z6LCy). We have a main channel to discuss the news, and a few breakout groups for local geographic communities. We are soon opening a few more city channels, so please DM me to make sure your region is represented.

Finally, we have a new version of our AI-augmented Purpose explorer. I spent the last few days headfirst in [Cursor](http://cursor.com) programming with Claude and GPT4 in order to develop a more robust and shareable experience. Everyone will receive a test link soon, but if you have a few minutes to spare and don’t mind some rough edges, just DM me for a test link.

Until next week,
MZ

#### Diffusion Gaming

This is absolutely fascinating: diffusion models being used to simulate DOOM with surprising accuracy. The videos look like ordinary gameplay, but it is in fact a neural model trained on the game, running at 20-30 FPS.

> The task that generative A.I. has been most successful at is lowering our expectations, both of the things we read and of ourselves when we write anything for others to read. It is a fundamentally dehumanizing technology because it treats us as less than what we are: creators and apprehenders of meaning. It reduces the amount of intention in the world.
