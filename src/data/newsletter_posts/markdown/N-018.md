Happy early September everyone\!

This week‚Äôs newsletter attempts to showcase some of the big ideas shaping the unfolding area of creative AI. The integration of computational creativity into our workflows is not just a diversion, it's becoming a cornerstone of all kinds of thinking. The value of AI isn't merely in automating tasks but in augmenting human capabilities to think beyond traditional boundaries. It's like adding another layer to the mind's canvas, granting us more shades of creativity than we thought possible.

The concept of _centaurs_ in AI takes this collaboration a step further, suggesting a symbiosis between machine learning algorithms and human intuition. This idea builds on the belief that while AI excels in crunching numbers and identifying patterns at a scale impossible for humans, it lacks the emotional intelligence, ethics, and nuanced understanding that come naturally to us. On the flip side, humans can't process vast amounts of data or perform complex calculations in milliseconds. When you combine these different kinds of intelligence‚Äîalgorithmic and human‚Äîyou get a "centaur": an entity that harnesses the strengths of both its components, akin to the mythical creature that's part horse and part human. Such a pairing is already revolutionizing not just how we approach problems, but also how we innovate, empathize, and change as a society.

##### Emerging Vocabulary

### Vector Database

_A type of database that's specifically designed to handle vector data, unlike traditional relational databases that store data in tabular form. Vector databases work best with multidimensional data, which is mostly used in machine learning applications, recommendation systems, and image/audio processing. They are optimal for situations where high-speed similarity searches and efficient storage of vast datasets are critical._
