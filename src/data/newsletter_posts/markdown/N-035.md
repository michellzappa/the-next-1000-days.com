Happy Monday and halfway point of January. The year has barely begun and it feels to me we are already all full speed. The new year always feels like an opportunity to pare down responsibilities and reconsider priorities, yet it feels that the moment the transition is behind us, bad habits and overcommitment quickly come back in full swing.

The year will certainly be defined by another wave of AI advancements. 2023 had us talking about nothing else quite as much as AI, and we have every indication for the year ahead to be much the same. GPT 5 might be around the corner and every other nation state and corporation seems focused on progressing their AI agendas. Good thing you’re already reading the right newsletter to stay ahead\!

On a personal note, I’ll be moving to Amsterdam next month to advance _our_ AI agenda. We’ll have more to announce soon, but I’m excited about moving back somewhere that so feels like home and to be working with friends and bright minds on bringing AI to their organizations and cities.

Until next week,
MZ

#### Stop trying to make sci-fi real

[Sci-fi author Charles Stross argues](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/tech-billionaires-need-to-stop-trying-to-make-the-science-fiction-they-grew-up-on-real/) in Scientific American that tech billionaires need to stop trying to make the science fiction they grew up on real. Great read, considering the inevitability of some form of corporate-owned AGI.

> Billionaires chase, in SF dreams,
> Earth's future twists, in extreme schemes.
> Ideals misplaced, caution tales ignored.

#### Don’t miss: 2024 Trend Reports + ChatGPT

[I’m presenting a very hands-on AI experiment this Thursday on Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7151175872132050946/). Every year a couple of friends organize and share a Google Drive with all public end-of-year trend reports. Me and a few other speakers thought of looking at these using AI, and will be sharing our insights and learnings.

You can try the CustomGPT here: [Meta Trends 2024](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-FeaSs2aKF-meta-trends-2024).
