Happy Monday ‚Äì and welcome to your weekly antidote to brainrot: a hand-picked batch of videos, articles, and memes to help you make sense of the moment.

Sensemaking around AI is like chasing a mirage.

The landscape is changing fast. Signals are everywhere. Capabilities evolve daily. Even those working deep in the field feel they‚Äôre falling behind. Tracking what AI _can_ do has become a full-time job ‚Äî and there‚Äôs no sign of a slowdown. Instead, we‚Äôre likely headed for a [fast takeoff](https://www.envisioning.io/vocab/fast-takeoff) toward superintelligence within a few years.

In 2019, I [interviewed 100 people](https://www.michellzappa.com/blog/the-interview-2019) about their relationship to technology. The first question I asked: _Does it feel like the world is speeding up?_

[80% said yes](https://www.michellzappa.com/blog/question-1-2019). 10% said no. 10% weren‚Äôt sure.

This was before AI took center stage.

Today, the sensation of accelerating time is even more acute. Some, like Terence McKenna, described it as _fractal time_ ‚Äî but even poetic metaphors fall short of explaining the collective experience.

To me, it feels like a **collapse of boundaries**.

AI is a snapshot of our collective unconscious. A probability wave collapsing into meaning. A reflection of our biases, hopes, and defaults ‚Äî pointing us toward brilliance, or mediocrity.

Every AI output is a portal into latent space ‚Äî a remix of all that could be. That‚Äôs why it excels at style transfer: surface without substance, essence abstracted from form. It mirrors us, even when we can‚Äôt recognize the reflection.

Until next week,
MZ

PS. Thanks Akemi ü§ç for this week‚Äôs post-apocalyptic imagery.

NotebookLM makes everything sound interesting, but this podcast that Chris Rimmer created by dropping our WhatsApp chat log is so much fun. Thanks to everyone in the [group](https://chat.whatsapp.com/FOirxUglTn6Fx7XD2iUm4L) for making it such an awesome place. I only wish they stuck to the landing in the episodes - which usually end abruptly.

#### Italian Brain Rot (NYT)

One of my favorite unexpected outcomes of AI generated imagery is [Italian](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/style/italian-brain-rot-ballerina-cappuccina.html?unlocked_article_code=1.E08.O7vW.HyD4YhQ1TBxK&smid=url-share) (Unlocked NYT link). Ballerina Cappuccina and other [slop](https://www.envisioning.io/vocab/slop)-like characters are taking over TikTok with unhinged energy. I‚Äôm unabashedly loving it.
