# 078

Happy Monday and welcome to your weekly download of \(human\) perspectives about what machines are up to.

Had you told me two years ago that I’d be spending around $100 each month on AI tools, I would probably not have believed you. Today, I consider the investment a minimum for staying on top of what is even possible.

My needs are likely different from yours, but the sheer amount of value I am getting from having access to a half-dozen specialized [state of the art](https://www.envisioning.io/vocab/sota-state-of-the-art) apps at my disposal is staggering. Some of these apps might be consolidated as model capabilities progress, yet I suspect the opposite will happen, where more and more valuable edge cases will pop up and make possible things I haven’t dreamed of.

You don’t have to run a company to appreciate their utility, and while my individual needs don’t necessarily apply to you, here is my attempt at justifying the business expenses that keep on giving.

* **[Cursor](https://www.cursor.com)** an unbelievably powerful code editor with deep LLM integration. By asking the right questions even a non-developer like myself has [managed](https://www.navigatewithin.com) to [build](https://www.gptarot.ai) a [handful](https://www.michellzappa.com/) of [legitimate web apps](https://www.envisioning.io/vocab/). \($20/month\)

* **[Chat](https://www.chat.com)** as OpenAI is apparently rebranding their [generative pre-trained transformer](https://www.envisioning.io/vocab/gpt-generative-pre-trained-transformer) is the OG. I don’t use it nearly as much as Claude nowadays but the native desktop app and voice mode are areas where others have to catch up. \($20/month\)

* **[Claude](https://www.claude.ai)** became my favorite chat app in 2024. Maybe it’s the mellow color scheme, or perhaps the smart approach for managing projects, but I find myself asking Claude most things today. If the ‘new’ Sonnet 3.5 feels like a 4.0 release, I can only imagine what’s brewing at Anthropic. \($20/month\)

* **[Raycast](https://www.raycast.com)** is a slick launcher for your computer with built-in chat. I use it mostly for simple questions suited for GPT-4o-mini or Claude 3.5 Haiku. \($10/month for pro service, not AI in particular\).

* **[Poe](https://poe.com)** is the best way of testing new models, especially image, video and open-source ones. For me things means using Flux Pro and Ideogram, but also experimenting with Gemini’s longer context windows and testing open-source models like Llama and Mistral. \($20/month\)

* **[Granola](https://www.granola.ai)** feels like a superpower for someone who spends hours every day in meetings. It runs locally on your computer to transcribe and summarize conversations _around your notes_. It’s truly a [centaur](https://www.envisioning.io/vocab/centaur) approach for intelligence augmentation. \($10/month\)

* **[GitHub CoPilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)** complements my Cursor needs for niche things like describing code commits, but I know GitHub is working on increasing its capabilities to take on Cursor. \($10/month\)

* **Ongoing API costs** : I spend between a coffee and a lunch every month on various API costs for automated projects like the [Vocab](https://www.envisioning.io/vocab/).

I hope this is useful.

Until next week,
MZ

Anil Ananthaswamy, author of _[Why Machines Learn](https://bookshop.org/p/books/why-machines-learn-the-elegant-math-behind-modern-ai-anil-ananthaswamy/20578439?ean=9780593185742)_ , [unpacks the elegant mathematics behind AI and its pattern-matching capabilities](https://youtu.be/URtF_UHYBSo). He emphasizes the need for broader societal understanding of AI’s limitations and potential, advocating for informed engagement to guide its responsible use.

> _It's only when we understand the math that we can see machines are doing sophisticated pattern matching, not reasoning._

#### Book Club

After listening to Ananthaswamy's interview on Machine Learning Street Talk \(above\), I started reading his recent book and am confident I'll make it through it despite my rusty high school math. If you want to join a book club of sorts please DM to join our small cohort of fans.

#### Envisioning Vocab

I have been experimenting with collecting different quantitative aspects of each [vocab](https://www.envisioning.io/vocab/) term in order to look for groupings or clusters.

You can explore generative measurements for things like _popularity_ \(how many people use it\), _safety_ \(how important it is from a risk perspective\), generality \(how fundamental it is to the field\) and a few other methods. Read more about the methodology. Very cursory and simplistic but results in an interesting way of navigating the index.
