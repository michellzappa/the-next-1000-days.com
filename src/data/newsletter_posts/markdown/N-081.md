Happy Monday and welcome to your weekly countdown to [foom](https://www.envisioning.io/vocab/foom) & gloom.

Of all the issues we face in a post-AI society, the one standing out to me as most concerning is the generational skill gap we are setting ourselves up for.

Consider the complexity of all our built systems, and ask yourself what would happen if we could no longer maintain them. We all rely on tens of thousands of interdependent systems to keep our societies functioning. Some of these are local, some are national and some international. From our electric grids to banking to the universities preparing next generations, together we rely on a staggering number of [hyperobjects](https://www.envisioning.io/vocab/hyperobject) which together enable our collective affordances and expectations as a society.

Among these systems, one stands out not only for its complexity but for its unparalleled rate of change: AI. Unlike traditional infrastructures, which evolve incrementally, AI’s development is driven by exponential advances in computing power, investment, and societal expectations. The compounding effect of trillions of dollars and peak ambitions accelerates this transformation, reinforcing the narrative that AI will soon redefine the fabric of our world.

It’s easy to overlook what might happen if we lose the ability to advance or even maintain these systems. We share an implicit assumption that there will be an increasingly qualified workforce interested and ready to pick up the research and development after we are gone. Assumptions can be misleading. Maybe I should not have re-watched [Idiocracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiocracy) before the elections, but there is a very real scenario where next generations are unprepared or even uninterested in carrying the torch of scientific progress, and instead fall into the trap of increased dependence without a proportional degree of involvement.

The AIs would seem as gods to them.

Future generations might inherit AI systems from us, perceiving them as mystical tools operated through incomprehensible means. The AIs would run our society to their own will, and leave only enough wiggle room to keep us alive and entertained.

I am not convinced this is avoidable. I’m born in 1982, and as a digital native consider technology a second language. I was brought up with [explainable](https://www.envisioning.io/vocab/explainability) systems which could be safely disassembled and reassembled. The enclosed systems kids today are growing up with don’t necessarily create the same sense of ownership, and instead of empowering us, our current tablets and smartphones set a completely different set of expectations: that technology is neat and contained and available off the shelf. I hear from professors, parents and IT professionals that Gen Z and Alpha are simply not tech savvy in a way that we would recognize. While digitally native, they struggle with complex systems and fundamentally [don’t understand](https://old.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/155os6m/i_found_out_to_be_true_that_gen_z_are_less/) [abstractions like file systems](https://old.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/11k0ed5/gen_z_also_doesnt_understand_desktops_after/) – arguably because these have been polished away by operating systems like iOS.

Maybe this is a ridiculous extrapolation on my behalf, and maybe I am missing the forest for the trees, and maybe we will all be impressed by the acumen and preparedness of the generations set to inherit our world. Let’s hope so.

Until next week,
MZ

**The Future of AI in the Workplace \(17 min\)**

Hosted by FT journalist Isabelle Baric, [this discussion unpacks the collision of AI’s potential with its uneven adoption in the workplace](https://youtu.be/hQX_wIW9Nh0). Leaders are racing to implement AI tools but are overlooking workforce preparedness: 43% of employees report no guidance on AI use. Salesforce research highlights stark divides—“maximalists” embrace AI eagerly, while “observers” take a wait-and-see stance. Companies investing in AI without addressing trust, clarity, and training risk inefficiencies. An interesting highlight: a Slack survey revealed that managers fostering trust double AI adoption rates among employees. This underscores that technology adoption isn’t merely technical but deeply human.
