# Don't Believe Everything You Think (120)

# How shared reasoning expands awareness.

This newletter began with the intention of covering our transition to AGI. I still believe 'generality' is next for AI, and that most of us will experience it in our lifetimes. Doing this involves learning, testing, and building things with AI.

Over time, I am realizing the work might become something else: a slow, structured attempt to document how I use AI. Not the tools themselves, but the mechanics of collaboration – how reasoning changes when shared, and what that reveals about thought. **different intelligences**

Thinking with AI feels less like outsourcing cognition and more like extending it. It’s a way of tracing how ideas form, fracture, and return clearer. By writing what I believe and watching it reflected back, I see my thinking as a living system—open, self-correcting, and occasionally surprising. What once stayed internal now becomes a shared exploration, where clarity is a side effect of attention.

Each chapter explores a different dimension of that collaboration. Thinking is first, because everything else begins here: before creation, before strategy, before meaning. These are not polished essays but field notes—records of actual interactions, where AI helps me observe my own mind at work. They show what it’s like to reason with another intelligence, and what that process teaches about being human.

1. Concept Refinement
   Turning intuition into clear language through dialogue.
   When a thought is still forming, I describe it roughly and let AI question, restate, and reframe. The back-and-forth peels away noise until the core idea stands on its own.
2. Strategic Thinking
   Stress-testing reasoning before it becomes action.
   I outline my logic and ask for counterpoints or blind spots. The friction of disagreement sharpens judgment and reduces costly assumptions.
3. Philosophical Correspondence
   Exploring contradictions without seeking closure.
   I treat abstract questions as open terrain—using AI to map worldviews, contrast ideas, and hold paradoxes without forcing them into conclusions.
4. Comparative Analysis
   Seeing trade-offs by changing the frame, not the facts.
   By rephrasing a single decision through multiple perspectives, I can see how framing itself shapes outcome and bias.
5. Temporal Thinking
   Tracing ideas across timescales.
   I feed present signals and patterns into AI to imagine how they might evolve. The process turns foresight into a discipline of language—using words to model change.
